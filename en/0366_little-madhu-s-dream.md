# Little Madhu's Dream

##
"What is it you are thinking of Madhu?" asked Gowri Miss.

Miss Gowri was the 1st Grade Class Teacher. She taught English. Every child in 1st Grade liked her a lot.

"I had a dream yesterday night. I was thinking about it."

"Interesting. What did you dream about?" asked Gowri Miss.

"I saw you flying like a bird in my dream." replied Madhu.

"Oh. That's nice. Did I fly well? What was the color of my wings?" asked Gowri Miss.

"You had white wings." replied Madhu.

"That's nice. What else did you dream of dear?" asked Gowri Miss.

##
"I had a dream that I am flying an aeroplane." replied Madhu.

"Interesting. Do you like Aeroplanes that much?" asked Gowri Miss.

"I love aeroplanes. I like to see them flying in the air. I want to fly an aeroplane every day." said Madhu.

"Awesome. You need to be a pilot for that."

##
"Yes. I want to be a Pilot when I grow up."

##
"I will learn to take off the Aeroplane."

##
"I will learn to use the buttons properly." quipped Madhu in excitement.

"Madhu. Do you know where these buttons are found in the aeroplane?" asked Gowri Miss.

"Yes Miss. The buttons and controls are found in the Cockpit. The pilots sit in the Cockpit too. Amma and Appa have told me all about it and even taken me once there." replied Madhu.

"Oh. That's nice. Where do you want to fly to?" asked Gowri Miss.

##
"I want to fly to Delhi." replied Madhu.

"Why Delhi?" asked Gowri Miss.

"Because my amma told me that it is very far. I can fly along with the birds for a long time then." replied Madhu.

##
"I want to fly near the clouds." I want to fly as high as the birds." continued Madhu.

"I am so proud of you, Madhu. I wish your dreams come true one day." said Gowri Miss.

"Thank You Gowri Miss." replied Madhu.

Hi friends,

This is Madhu here.

My dream is to be a Pilot.

What is your dream to be?

Do tell me.

Bye-Bye for now.

It is very easy for the kids to learn the concept of Nouns - Proper and Common and Verbs when they get to see/read them in/from a book.

In this short story, the Proper Nouns are in Bold, while the Common Nouns are in Italics.

The few verbs which are used in this story are Underlined.

Not all nouns and verbs are addressed with these notations. I have just highlighted very few.

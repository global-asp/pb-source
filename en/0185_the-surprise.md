# The Surprise

##
There were two girls called Sara and Zara they were twins. They both longed for a merry -go -round because they didn't have one at home. Merry-go-rounds were lots of fun and enjoyable.

##
The next day when they were going to school Zara saw something. She went closer to it. She realised that it was a poster she called Sara and they looked at it. It said there would be a circus with a playground. The girls thought there was a merry go round so they decided to go to the circus.

##
After a few days they went to the circus. They hunted in the playground but there was no merry-go-round. Zara decided to give up and so did Sara. They were very sad.

##
The twins were very sad. Their older sister tried to cheer them up. She dressed up in funny clothes, she made ugly faces and she made hilarious jokes. Nothing worked so she gave up. The twins began to get bored so they went to the local park.

##
All of a sudden they froze. They saw something they really wanted.............

##
A merry-go-round!!!!However happy they were they couldn't control their excitement. They had a lot of fun. And in their point of view It Was The BEST DAY EVER!!!!:]

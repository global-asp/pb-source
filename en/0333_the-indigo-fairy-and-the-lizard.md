# The Indigo Fairy and the Lizard

##
As Kian by dandelion flew, the dark clouds in the sky grew. Sheltering under a mushroom top, Kian watched the rain go plop! plop! plop!

Plopity plop appeared a puddle, from past experience, Kian found himself wanting a cuddle...
So he joined the glow worms in a warm loving huddle.

“To stay warm and dry, if into that house you go, you will meet my friend, the lizard!” said the worms that glow.

##
As Kian jumped onto the window sill, he saw the lizard sitting very still.

A little girl entered the room, saw the lizard, screaming “AAArrgghh!!”, arms waving went zoom!

##
“What, dear lizard, was that?!” asked Kian.

“Aw! That's just her way of saying hello! She is a sweet little dope!

I eat the flies, mosquitoes and other insects that bite, just so she can sleep well at night!!” replied the lizard.

Watching the lizard hunt and gobble down prey was interesting; however Kian really could not stay.

##
“Aaargh!!” shouted Kian, arms waving. “What was that?!” asked the puzzled glow worms.

“Well It would seem wherever I go, I learn a new way of saying hello!!”

“Dear Fairy, while I am sure saying hello like that is fun, I must warn you that it might make some people run!”
After some thought, Kian replied, “Oh, of course you are right, it is just not polite to give others a fright!”

# My Best Friend

##
I have a friend. She lives in my house.

##
When I am happy, so is she.

##
When I cry, she cries too.

##
But I cannot hear her voice. My friend lives inside the mirror.

##
“Come out,” I tell her, “we will play.” She does not come out.

##
I am not happy. I go to sleep.

##
She comes out of the mirror in my sleep! And we have fun.

##
We play, we run, we shout and scream together.

##
When I talk to her, she also talks to me.

##
In the morning, my friend will go back into the mirror.

##
But I don't mind at all. We will play again in my dreams!

# The Girl and the Bear

##
A girl went to a place, that was a forest. When she went there flood came because of rain. There was a bear, that was watching that girl thinking that what she is doing there.

##
All of a sudden fishes have started raining from the sky and bear started catching the fishes. The girl saw the bear and was frightened and fell down.

After some time she woke up because of the rain drops. Bear was good. It didn't do any harm to the girl.

##
The girl was hungry, she didn't had anything to eat. Bear gave so many fishes to her & they became friends. Next day the rain was coming and coming, they didn't had any shelter for hiding. Bear was telling that tomorrow is my birthday and i think tomorrow will also rain. She forgot that she had a birthday cake with her.

##
She remembered that she had a cake. Next day, rain stopped and the girl asked bear to close the eyes, after some time (after arranging the birthday cake) asked bear to open the eyes and showed the table with cake. Bear never saw anything like this before, so it was very happy.

##
Bear blew the candles, as the girl sang happy birthday song.

##
The girl never left the bear, she lived along with the bear, lifelong. They lived happily.

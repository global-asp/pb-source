# Tilly and Kyle make Vegetable Curry

##
Ammamma is sleeping. Tilly and Kyle were very hungry.

The telephone rang. "May I help you?", asked Kyle. It was Amma calling to say she would be late home from work. She was a nurse at the hospital. She was calling to remind Ammamma that friends were coming to eat a meal with them at their house that evening.

##
The children decided to make a meal. Kyle said to Tilly, "Look at all the dirty vessels! I'll wash one while you look in the refrigerator."

##
Tilly said, "Look! There are lots of different vegetables in the refrigerator. Let's make a vegetable curry and surprise Ammamma!"

##
Kyle and Tilly got busy peeling and cutting vegetables to make the vegetable curry.

##
It was hard work but they had fun doing it together.

##
They put lots of vegetables and some spices into the large vessel to cook on the gas burner.

##
It was not long before Ammamma woke up when there was a knock on the door. When she opened the door, there were all her friends who had arrived to share a meal.

Ammamma turned to see Kyle lifting a big pot off the burner. She was happy to know they would have tasty food to share with her family and friends.

##
Ammamma was so pleased with Tilly and Kyle. Everyone could smell the delicious food waiting to be eaten.

When Amma arrived home, she told Kyle and Tilly how proud of them she was too.

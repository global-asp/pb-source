# Tree on a plate

##
Dinner time is fun for Roma. She does many things on her plate

##
Ma gives her rice. Roma makes a hill from it. White hill with steam coming from the top.

##
Roma pours dal on her rice. She thinks it makes a small yellow lake. She laughs when she dips a spoon in her yellow lake

##
There is a green forest on her plate. There are leaves. Some are big and some are small. She likes some. But she does not like some.

##
She likes a vegetable that looks like a tree. It has a round top like a mango tree.

##
The 'tree vegetable' also has a stock. It is almost white in colour Roma thinks it looks like a happy tree.

##
Do you know what is Roma's happy tree? We call it cauliflower. Roma likes it very much. I love it too. What about you?

# Daddy's Mo

##
Anu likes many things about Daddy. She likes the bright paper lanterns he makes, the crisp onion pakodas he fries and the cute tortoise he makes out of paper. Besides, he climbs the stairs with a hop, and wrestles with Uncle for fun. When guests come over, he always makes them laugh.

Anu likes all these things about Daddy.

But do you know what Anu likes most of all? Daddy's moustache!

##
Every morning as Daddy shaves, Anu sits by and watches him carefully.

Daddy holds his tiny pair of scissors between his two fingers, and with a snip-snip-snip he trims his moustache. Anu says, “Now a little to the left...now a bit to the right...no no, Daddy! Don't make your moustache small! I won't talk to you if you do!”

##
When Daddy comes out of the shower, Anu takes a little comb and brushes his moustache neatly.

She then holds both ends between her fingertips and gives them a twirl!

Then Daddy's moustache looks stiff and proud.

“Done, Daddy! Now don't you mess it up, okay?” she says sternly.

##
Anu always thinks, if Daddy wears a smart tunic and a turban and rides a tall horse, with a sword across his belt, how grand he'll look!

Just like a soldier wearing glasses!

##
Actually, Anu likes anyone with a moustache. Like the dad of her friend Tuti, whose real name is Smruti. He has such a fat moustache! He must need a big fat comb to brush it.

Tuti's dad plays very good tennis. But really, he should be a wrestler.

If he wears a pleated turban and carries a giant club on his shoulder, he'll look just great!

##
Sahil's dad has a pencil-thin moustache. Anu wonders how he manages to trim it so fine.

If he wears a tall black hat, a long black overcoat and dark glasses, he'll look just like the detective on TV, who catches all the thieves!

##
But Grandpa who lives next door has the best moustache of all! It looks as if a big white cloud has come down from the sky to live under his nose! His mouth is hidden behind the cloud.

Anu is anxious about Grandpa... how can he eat with that cloud in the way?

##
Anu wonders why a moustache doesn't grow under her nose.

Every morning she wets her soap, makes a lot of lather and gives herself many different kinds of moustaches.

“My moustache is the best,” she says. “It's pure white, and so soft! Isn't it nice?” she asks, happily.

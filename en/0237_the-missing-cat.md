# The missing cat

##
Ruchi had a cat named Reena. Ruchi loved and cared for Reena so much that she would not let anyone touch Reena.

##
Ruchi played with Reena day and night till they got tired.

##
Ruchi fed Reena fish and milk. After a few years, Ruchi was sent to school.

##
So when Ruchi was studying under a tree, Reena would sit on top of the tree and listen.

##
One such day when Ruchi came back from school, Reena was gone. Ruchi searched the wholetown, but she was not there.

##
Ruchi was heartbroken on that day. She pinned up missing posters all around the town.

##
One day when Ruchi was drinking milk, she saw Reena running towards. At last, Ruchi had found her dream cat, Reena.

# Rachel and Big Ben

##
Rachel was a fun loving 12 year old girl. She had a stuffed toy that was huge and she just loved him.

The stuffed toy was with her since she was three years old. He had become old, little faded yet Rachel adored him.

One night just before her stuffed toy's birthday, she had a dream.

##
In the dream, Rachel saw herself and her stuffed toy going on an adventurous picnic in a jungle, but it suddenly started raining rather heavily.

The toy had become alive and Rachel was amazed to see he was closing his ears on hearing the thunder.

##
Soon Rachel found she was in a huge puddle of water and she was getting separated from her friend, her stuffed toy whom she had named Big Ben.

Rachel had plans for Big Ben in the jungle. But she was getting pulled by strong waters in a river. Thankfully she was able to get herself out from the waters. And Big Ben too worked his way out of the waters.

##
Aha! When both Big Ben and Rachel were on the banks of the river, Rachel removed lots of goodies from her backpack. She had planned a surprise birthday party for Big Ben.

Big Ben was delighted.

He had never had a birthday party as a stuffed toy.

Then Rachel told him that whether he is alive or just as a stuffed toy; she will always be fond of him equally.

##
Big Ben blew the candles on the cake that was even then fresh and had a great day with Rachel.

When Rachel woke up the next morning she had a huge smile on her face and she ran to her stuffed toy to give him a tight bear hug before getting ready for school.

It was a sunny morning Bhalu the bear was taking his usual stroll in the woods. He inhaled the fresh smell of the poppies which was standing near him. Just then a cool breeze swept past him. He saw the poppies and began to smile at them with glee.

Suddenly the tree began to speak "Hey Bhalu! sit down and get your drawing book you can draw anything you like I'll provide you with my cool breeze.

Bhalu decided to listen to the talking tree he went home to get his book.

He got his drawing book and sat in the cool shade of the tree. He smiled and drew a map of the world. The tree was amazed to see Bhalu's talent. Then Bhalu drew a picture of him and the tree hugging together the tree was appeased he smiled and called his friends They all began to shower him with their cool breeze. THen really the tree with it's branches hugged Bhalu They became best friends.

Bhalu went home and got his camera to take photos with him and his friend and the poppies and the trees which generously gave him the cool breeze. His friend winked and he gave poses for Bhalu's camera. Then Bhalu went to the poppies and took photos of them. Then the trees which gave bhalu lots of breeze also gave poses for Bhalu's camera.

I won't let anybody cut you or chop you until i'm there for you buddy. The tree was touched by the devotion of the bear. He said

"Thank you dear friend!" There is a Museum nearby you must visit it and then only you should go home if you value me please do that. "Of course friend!". I will come everyday to this place i'll see you tomorrow.

# Clean Cat

##
This is my house. Ma, Pa and Cheena also live here.

##
The best chair in the house is for me. But sitting on the lap is even better, isn't it?

##
Cheena is my best friend. I wait for her to return from school.

##
I keep myself clean without water. I do not need a bath like Tommy.

##
Shhh... don't tell anyone that I am hiding here.

1...2...3... Got you!

##
Ma shouts at me, when I bring some tasty food from the garden.

##
I can climb trees. I can jump. I know all the short cuts here.

##
Sanju lives nearby. He teases me. It makes me very angry.

##
Please tell Sanju that the tiger is from our cat family. We have sharp claws.

##
My friends sometimes make a lot of noise at night. By then I am quietly in bed.

##
Tails can speak!

Did you know how animals and birds tell us something by using their tails?

A dog wags its tail when it is happy. A cat puffs up its tail when it is angry.

Often we say, “As clean as a cat”. This is because cats do not like water, yet they are always keeping themselves clean by licking themselves.

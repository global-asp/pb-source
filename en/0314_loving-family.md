# Loving Family

##
Little Anu had a concentration problem. Whenever she tried to concentrate, something distracted her. So she was not able to study properly and started getting less marks in school. One day when her teacher was announcing an English test for the next day, Anu was distracted as usual and failed to listen. Next day in the test, half her answers were wrong and she got very poor marks. The teacher was very angry with Anu and promptly wrote a note in her diary for her parents to sign.

##
Anu was terrified how her parents would react to not only her poor marks in English, but to the note in her diary. Thinking about the evening ahead depressed her. She knew mamma and pappa would be upset with her.

##
Anu reached home and was about to knock when she saw her mother returning from office. “How was your day?” she asked, giving Anu a hug. Little yo came running and gave her a tight hug and said “Hi didi! I missed you.”

##
Anu's exhaustion melted away and she felt happy that she had a loving family with her. Anu knew at the end of the day, a loving family should find everything forgivable and her parents will do the same. She made a resolution that from now on, she will concentrate and pay attention in class. Listen carefully to her teacher and get good marks. As Anu expected her parents forgave her and told her to forget the present situation and strive instead to get good marks next time The day ended with the four of them having a good time.

Being a family means you are a part of something very wonderful. It means you will love and be loved for the rest of your life.

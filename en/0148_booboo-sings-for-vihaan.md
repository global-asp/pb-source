# BooBoo sings for Vihaan

##
One day Vihaan wanted to play. Vihaan is a small baby and cannot talk. So he started crying. His Mamma heard him cry and thought of something to make Vihaan laugh. So she called the BooBoo Bear!

##
The BooBoo bear was a jolly golly lolly-loving bear! So Vihaan's Mamma gave him a lolly and asked him to meet Vihaan. BooBoo laughed and went to meet little Vihaan! He carried MushyMushy, his pet mushroom with him.

##
"VIHAAN, look!," said BooBoo. "Meet my lushy wushy MushyMushy!" BooBoo threw MushyMushy in the air as Vihaan looked.

##
Boinggggg! Zoinnggggg! Toingggg! fell Mushy-Mushy on Vihaan's round head and on the ground. Vihaan looked at it and THEN....

##
WAAAAAAAAAAA! BAAAAAAAAAA! GAAAAAAAAA! he cried. Vihaan's Papa came running and kissed Vihaan's doly roly poly head.

##
WAAAAAAAAAAA! BAAAAAAAAAA! GAAAAAAAAA! he cried. Vihaan's Mamma came running and kissed Vihaan's doly roly poly head.

##
WAAAAAAAAAAA! BAAAAAAAAAA! GAAAAAAAAA! he cried. Vihaan's Aachi came running and kissed Vihaan's doly roly poly head. Aachi then whispered something in BooBoo bear's ritty-mitty-gritty ears.

##
"Don't cry Vihaan!," said BooBoo. "Why don't we sing a rappy-jappy-happy SONG!," he said. Vihaan stopped crying and looked at BooBoo with his big beautiful eyes.

##
So BooBoo started singing this song:

Gooshy Booshy Looooty hoi ik laaaaaanch

Then the Booboo bear said No No No!

Then the Booboo bear said Dont cry cry

Gooshy booshy looty hoi ik laaanch!

##
'HOHOHO HIHIHI!,' laughed Vihaan! 'HIRHIRHIR! HARHARHAR!' laughed BooBoo!

'Heeheehee Teeheeeheee!' laughed Mushy-Mushy

'HAHAHA HAHAHA' laughed Mamma, Papa and Aachi!

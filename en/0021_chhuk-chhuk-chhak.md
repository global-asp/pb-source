# Chhuk-Chhuk-Chhak

##
Nanhi picked up her slate and chalk.

She wanted to draw a long, l-o-n-g train.

##
Nanhi first drew an engine which gave out a lot of smoke, for the long, long train.

##
“Oh dear! Now where shall I make the coaches?” Nanhi wondered, for there was no more space on the slate.

##
Nanhi put the slate and chalk down on the floor and thought.

##
She drew a coach on the floor.

Then a second coach, then another, and another, and another... Nanhi just kept drawing.

##
Until her chalk got over.

Nanhi got up and took a look. Wow!

Her train was as long as the verandah!

##
And off went Nanhi's train – Chhuk-Chhuk-Chhak, from here to there, so very far!

# Aunty Jui's Baby

##
“Anuuuu! Wake up! Sleepyhead!” called Anu's mother.

“Mmmm...let me sleep!” mumbled Anu.

“Ok, then I'll go see Aunty Jui's baby by myself,” said Aai*.

*Aai, Marathi for mother

##
Anu sat up like a shot.

“Baby? Is it a teeny-tiny baby? Like a doll? Wait for me, I'm coming!”

##
Anu got ready in a jiffy.

She gulped down her milk without a fuss.

She didn't even cry when her mother combed her hair.

##
The moment Anu entered Aunty's house she shouted, “Aunty! Where is the baby?”

“Shhhh...” said Aunty Jui, with her finger on her lips. “Softly. The baby is sleeping.”

Sleeping? What a bore. Anu began to sulk.

##
Aai pulled Anu close. “The baby is still very small, Anu. You must not trouble her. After all, you are her big sister!”

Big sister! Anu felt very important. But why did the baby have to go to sleep?

##
Just then they heard a thin wail...

“She is up,” said Aunty, and gave the baby to Aai.

“I want to hold the baby,” said Anu.

“Oh no, Anu. You won't be able to. You're much too small,” said Aai.

“But I'm her big sister,” said Anu.

##
Why should the baby sit on Aai's lap? I want to sit on Aai's lap too, thought Anu. But Aai said, “Anu, move away! You must not bother baby. See how tiny she is?”

##
The baby was still wailing. “Waah...”

“Oh dear!” said Aunty. “I think she's soiled her nappy.”

She cleaned the baby and changed her nappy.

The baby gurgled happily.

##
Anu was disgusted. What a silly baby. Potty in the nappy!

And Aai and Aunty were mad! They didn't even scold the baby.

##
If I just pee in my underwear by mistake, Aai glares at me. But now look at her doing ‘kootchie-coo!' to the baby! Wait till I get home. I'll tell Baba how unfair Aai is.

##
“Let's go home, Aai!” Anu cried.

“Why, Anu, don't you like the baby?” asked Aunty. “Chee!” said Anu.

“Silly baby, does potty in the nappy, doesn't talk, doesn't play. I don't like your baby. Why did you get yourself such a silly baby?”

##
On the way back home, Anu asked her mother, “Aai, when will I become a baby?”

“You won't become a baby again, “ said Aai. “You'll grow bigger now.”

“I don't want to be big! I want to be a baby and I want to sleep in your lap, and I want to drink milk with a spoon and I want to sit on Baba's shoulders and go out and...”

Anu muttered all the way home.

##
The next day Aai said, ”Anu, let's give your small clothes, toys and cradle to Aunty Jui's baby, shall we?”

##
“No!” yelled Anu. “That's my ball and my cradle!”

“Okay, what about giving away these clothes then? They're so small,” said Aai.

“No!” shouted Anu again. “I want to wear them, NOW!” So Aai put the small frock on Anu. She even put the little baby bonnet on her head.

##
Anu crawled all over the house.

She balanced the ball on her head and wandered around, calling, ‘Curd! Fresh curd!' She played with the rattle: rat-a-tat-tat.

##
Anu climbed into the cradle. She wanted to lie down and suck her thumb.

But she didn't fit! Her feet stuck out at one end, and she couldn't keep her arms straight. The tight little frock began to pinch. Anu was fed up. This was no fun at all!

##
Anu said to her mother, “Aai, why don't we give this frock and bonnet and cradle to Aunty Jui's baby?”

“Give it all away? But then what will you do?” asked Aai.

“Aai, I'm a big sister now, aren't I? Once you become a big sister you wear proper clothes, and sleep on the bed.”

“Oh really? I had no idea!” said Aai, smiling.

Anu wore her own clothes and said, “Aai, tell baby that her big sister has given her all this. You'll tell her, won't you?”

Anu jumped on to her scooter and went off to play.

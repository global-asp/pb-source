# Abhinav and the Cat

##
It was a holiday for Abhinav. He saw a cat. He was reminded of his cartoon character Oggy. This must be Oggy he thought. He rushed to his mom and asked for milk to feed his Oggy.

##
He left the milk in a sauce and soon the cat drank way. He gave milk to the cat everyday and soon both of them turned friends.

##
He also started talking to Oggy," Oggy , you should be strong enough to drive away those cockroaches. Drink milk and become strong." And this became as one of his daily jobs.

##
Some days passed. One day after coming from school and finishing his homework , he sat to watch his catoon "Oggy and the Cockroaches." But he found there was no change in the behaviour and attitude of Oggy.

##
He asked his mom," Mom I gave so much milk and advised Oggy to win over the cockroaches. But still Oggy behaves the same and gets into trouble. "
His mom said," Your friend cat and Oggy are different. It is not Oggy."

##
"Oh!....... If my cat is not Oggy, then why should I give milk for the cat?" Abhinav asked.
His mom said " Abhinav, The cat is your friend. Also we have to share food and stuff with others because......."

##
"Because........ sharing is caring " Abhinav completed and added," My teacher taught me this."

Yes. He is right.

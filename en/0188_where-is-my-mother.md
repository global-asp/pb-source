# Where Is My Mother?

##
Hello everybody my name is Tammy the turtle, in this story I go through many trials to find my mother. It all began on one sunny afternoon, I was resting on marina beach . Mama said she would be away only for a few minutes but 5 hours have passed by since she left, just at that moment i felt a chill run run down my spine as i saw my sister being carried away by a large bird. After an hour or so I decided to search for mama. I had to go deep in the sea to look for mama. I crawled to the shallow part and began my journey. I was afraid at first but then slowly began to think that it was really fun.

on the way I fell back on a light coral which pushed me towards a sharp one , in the process i wounded my leg and I started to bleed. then a mermaid papered out of nowhere , without me saying a word she took out one of her pearly fins and covered my wound with, and without me noticing soon disappeared. The magic fin had stopped the bleeding and had healed the wound . I decided to take a cat nap . after about 10 minutes I thought I heard my mothers voice, at first I thought I was dreaming but when i opened my eyes i was surprised to see my mother right in front of me. She then said , " My dear daughter you have gone through so many trials to find me , now i know how much you love me"

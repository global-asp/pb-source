# Vayu, the Wind

##
Everytime I finish my hot, hot bath,

My wet body feels so cool, cool cool.

Who makes that happen?

Vayu the Wind!

##
The milk in my cup is too hot, too hot.

But soon it is ready for me to gulp.

Who makes that happen?

Vayu the Wind!

##
The window curtains flutter

And gently brush my face.

Who makes it happen?

Vayu, the Wind!

##
A bolt of lightning far away.

Black clouds moving my way.

Who makes that happen?

Vayu, the Wind!

##
Branches sway and leaves tremble.

Flowers gently fall.

Who did it all?

Vayu, the Wind!

##
Far from the house, we are playing,

Yet, I can smell the sweets mother is preparing.

Who makes it happen?

Vayu, the Wind!

##
A glass tumbler on a window sill,

Crashes on the ground.

Thank God, I was not around.

Who played this mischief?

Of course, it was Vayu, the Wind!

##
A whistle blows. A train rolls in.

I cannot see, but I hear its din.

Who makes that happen?

Vayu, the Wind!

##
Cannot be seen

Cannot be heard

Does all the work

Without a word.

Who can it be?

##
Of course!

The wind!

Vayu, the wind!

# Sister, Sister Why is the Sky So Blue?

##
Sister, sister, I wonder...

What do you wonder, little brother,

What do you wonder?

I wonder, I wonder, why the sky is so blue.

What do you think, little brother,

What do you think?

I think, I think...

Tell me, little brother,

what do you think?

##
I think

That maybe the sky

Is really an upside-down sea

With cloud-boats bobbing gently along.

That an E-NOR-MOUS sheet

Of clear plastic skin

Is stretched across that upside-down sea

To keep it in.

##
And sometimes the plastic tears a little

Here or there

Like plastic will

And then it rains.

I think that is why the sky is blue

Because it is a sea

And seas are blue.

I'm clever, aren't I, sister?

##
Oh yes you are, little brother, oh yes you are

And maybe you are right, too...

But in the books I have read

That is not what they said.

Then what did they say, sister,

what did they say?

What do you think, little brother,

what do you think?

I think, I think,

Tell me, little brother, what do you think?

##
I think

That maybe the old woman

Who lives in the sky

Washes her ENORMOUS blue saree each night

And spreads it out to dry in the sun

Each morning.

##
She is careful, the old woman

She pins the saree down with cloud-stones

So that the naughty wind

Cannot carry it away.

I think that is why the sky is blue

Because the old woman in the sky

Spreads her saree out to dry.

I'm clever, aren't I, sister?

##
Of course you are, little brother,

And maybe you are right, too...

But in the books that I have read

That is not what they said.

Then what did they say, sister,

What did they say?

What do you think, little brother,

what do you think?

I think, I think... Tell me, little brother,

What do you think?

##
I think

That maybe, one long-ago Holi

The shops ran out of every colour BUT blue.

And I think, that day,

Such an ENORMOUS cloud of blue dust rose

From laughing blue people everywhere,

That it reached up, up, up all the way

To the sky.

##
And the old woman, the one that lives up there,

She scrubs the sky each day

With cloud-cottonwool,

To get the stain out of the way.

I think that's why the sky is blue

Because of a stubborn stain

That drives the old woman insane.

I'm clever, aren't I, sister?

##
Oh yes, you are, little brother, oh yes you are

And maybe you are right, too...

But in the books I have read

That is not what they said.

Then what did they say, sister,

What did they say?

What do you think, little brother,

What do you think?

They said, they said...

Tell me, sister, what did they say?

##
They said

That there is a thick blanket of air

Around our blue and green earth

And that blanket is woven

Of millions of little things they call

Mo-le-cules.

##
They said

The air blanket is called

At-mos-phere.

But why is the sky so blue, sister,

Why is the sky so blue?

Be patient, little brother, be patient now.

##
They said

The golden light from the glorious sun

Is not golden at all

But white!

And what a white!

A rainbow-coloured white!

##
A violet-indigo-blue-green-yellow-orange-red white.

They said

It is the RAINBOW light

That comes to us

Through the At-mos-phere.

##
But the sky is blue, sister, not violet or yellow or green!

Listen, little brother, you'll see what I mean.

Now the Mo-le-cules in the At-mos-phere

Well, they are not very fair.

##
They let the red and the yellow and the orange light pass through

Mostly

And the green too

But the blue!

Oh, they give the blue a hard time!

What do they do to the blue, sister,

What do they do?

Tell me, sister, what do they do?

##
Well, when the sunlight strikes those

Millions and millions of MO-le-cules

They BOUNCE all that blue light

The blue, blue light's

Back where it came from;

And the poor blue light

Shatters, scatters

All over, ALL OVER, the sky

And turns it blue.

##
Can it be true, sister, can it be true?

I can't say, little brother, I can't say.

But in all the books that I have read

That is what they said.

FIND OUT MORE!

Why is the sky blue?

Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The gas molecules in the atmosphere interact with the sunlight before it reaches our eyes.

Each â€˜colour' of light is actually a different wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. Different wavelengths not only make up different colours, they also behave differently. Each of the different wavelengths in sunlight (or, in other words, each of the colours that sunlight is made up of) interacts differently with the molecules in the atmosphere.

When sunlight strikes the molecules, they scatter the blue light (which has a shorter wavelength) more than they do the red, orange, yellow and green lights (which have longer wavelengths). Since the blue portion is scattered more, the sky appears blue.

Try this experiment!

Why does the sky appear orange and red at dawn and dusk?

Let's try this exercise to find out.

You need:

A clear glass full of water

A little milk

A torch

What to do:

Shine the torch on the glass of water. Can you see the light in the water? Hardly. Now add a few drops of milk into the water. Then shine the torch again on the glass. This time, you will notice that the light is more visible. Add a few more drops of milk. Now you will notice that the light in the glass is distinctly blue.

Why does this happen?

When you add the first few drops of milk to

the water, the number of molecules in the

water increases. The fat and protein molecules in the milk scatter the light so that we can see it. When you increase the number of molecules by adding more milk, the light is scattered more, especially the blue light, which has a shorter wavelength.

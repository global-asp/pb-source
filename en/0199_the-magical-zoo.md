# The Magical Zoo

##
Once upon a time, here was a magical jungle in which all the animals could talk and sing, but one an elephant named 'JUMBO' could not do those things. So he felt very sad. One day , there was a running race in the zoo , for the animals. The elephant came very well trained but the others started telling him a slow poke but Jumbo did not lose hope. At the end, Jumbo came out victorious .

Moral: Never judge someone.

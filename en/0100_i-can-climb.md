# I Can Climb!

##
I am a big boy now.

##
I can climb up the steps.

##
But I cannot climb down again.

##
I can climb on a chair.

##
But I cannot climb down again.

##
I climb on to the chair, and then on the table!

##
But I cannot climb down again.

##
“Papa! Papa!” I shout.

Papa laughs. “Sonu, learn to climb down!” he says.

##
I am afraid. But I do not cry.

##
Slowly, I get down from the table, and down from the chair.

##
At last, I have learnt to climb down too!

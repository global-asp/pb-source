# Playtime

##
The little elephant's name was Golu. He was as round as a drum. The little rabbit was called Chhotu. He looked like a ball of cotton.

##
They played together.

One day, Golu said, “Let's play a new game today.”

##
“You sit down. I'll land on your back in one flying leap,” said Chhotu. Golu sat down. Chhotu took a mighty leap.

##
Thump! He landed on Golu's back.

“Wow!” laughed Golu and said, “My turn now. You sit down and I will leap on your back.”

##
“You!”

“Yes, me.”

“How can you do that?” asked Chhotu.

##
"Like this!" Golu showed him.

##
Thud... thud... thud...

A shower of coconuts came down on Golu's head.

##
He ran away on fat legs, scared.

##
One small coconut fell on Chhotu.

##
‘That's better,' thought Chhotu, ‘Better a coconut than an elephant on my head!'

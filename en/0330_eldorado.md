Eldorado

Gaily bedlight,

A gallent knight,

In sunshine and in shadow,

Had journeyed long,

singing a song,

In search of Eldorado.

But he grew old

This knight so bold

And over his heart a shadow

Fell as he found

No spot of ground

That looked like Eldorado

And, as he strength

Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim shadow

'Shadow', said he

Where can it be

'The land of Eldorado?'

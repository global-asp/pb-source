# Suraj and Sher Singh

Suraj has a very special ball. He calls it Sher Singh. One day, Suraj was playing in the park with Sher Singh, the tiger-ball.

##
A dog picked up Sher Singh by his ear and shook him.

Sher Singh opened the dog's mouth and flew out.

Sher Singh opened the dog's mouth and flew out.

##
He landed on a slide and rolled down, down, down. A fat boy came sliding behind him.

##
Ouch!

Sher Singh pinched the fat boy.

##
The boy jumped up, and Sher Singh rolled on. He landed in a play tunnel and rolled round and round and round.

##
When Sher Singh jumped out, guess who was waiting for him?

Suraj!

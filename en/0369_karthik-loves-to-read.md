Karthik loved to read.

He loved to read about Fairies, Rain, Sun and Flowers.

During holidays, he would go to the park with his books, sit under a tree and simply begin to read.

##
He would sit in his room on his play mat and lean against his dog and begin to read.

He loved animals. He loved reading about animals.

Karthik's favorite book was the one on animals. His dad had gifted him one on his 5th birthday.

##
Karthik had an elder brother called Kaushik.

Kaushik loved reading too. Being older, Kaushik liked to read books on Math and Science.

##
Karthik's best friend was Kavya. They studied together in the same class in school.

Very often, Karthik would ask Kavya to read along with him.

After reading their books, they would tell each other what they read.

##
Sometimes he would ask Kavya to read a book aloud to him while he would listen to her in attention.

Such was Karthik's fondness for reading books.

Are you fond of reading books too? :)

Author's Note

--------------------

Books are an ideal gift for young readers..

Books instill strong feelings of confidence, courage and happiness in young minds.

They take them into a magical world where humans can fly, animals can talk, robots can sing and aliens can dance.

A few tips to instill reading habit in your child/children:

______________________________________________________________

1. Pamper your child or your children with books relevant to their age.

2. Talk to your child/children about the importance of reading books.

3. Spend at least 15-20 minutes of each day reading a book to your child or children.

4. Make a reading nook in your home, grab a book, one for yourself, one for your child and read together. If a dedicated reading nook is not possible, make any and every place your reading nook - on the bed, in center of your living room and even under the dining table :)

5. Take your child or children to Public Libraries and help them to choose/pick a book for reading.

6. Take them for story sessions happening in your locality once in a while.

7. Importantly, talk to them about the book they read.

Thanks!

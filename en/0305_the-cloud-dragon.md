# The Cloud Dragon

##
Lord Indra was worried sick! He had been away for so long, engaged in protecting heaven and coming up with new war tactics, that he had completely forgotten about his duties of sending clouds to a certain part of eastern India.

As a result, that area was struck with drought. The rivers went dry and the trees and plants began to die. People were in distress. Their prayers and pleas had reached Indra, but because of the ongoing battle in heaven he couldn't come down himself and relieve them of their miseries.

##
But Indra was a strategist and a witty God. He ordered one of his beloved pets, a cute blue dragon to become his substitute and visit this land struck with drought.

This blue dragon unlike other dragons didn't breath fire. He instead had a unique ability to breath clouds! Large puffy clouds.

He was a playful dragon and just like his master was witty and intelligent! He loved flying over the golden sun, high in the sky and over the deep green pastures of land below . But what he loved the most was, making clouds - clouds of all types, shapes and sizes.

##
Lord Indra told the blue dragon that he could make as many clouds as he wanted and could fly wherever he wanted to, but he needs to be careful that he doesn't come in contact with water. If that happens he will lose all his powers and become a human! Even a single drop of water could cost him his powers.

Now, the blue dragon loved being the cloud breathing dragon, and was puzzled with this clause. How was he to avoid water, when bringing rain to the land was the primary task assigned to him!

##
He thought about it for days and then an idea dawned upon him. He would get wet in the rain only if he was under the clouds, but not if he was on top of them.

So, the blue dragon made a huge blue rain cloud that covered the central part of the dry land. This cloud was monstrous in size and heavy enough to take the weight of a dragon.

After the cloud was ready, the dragon hopped upon it and struck lightning. Rains came down from the clouds and quenched the land's thirst.

##
The blue dragon spent the rest of his days living in his new home and making more and more clouds. These clouds brought rains to the land, filling the rivers with sweet water and nourishing and ripening the earth. People were happy once again.

And because the blue dragon made so many clouds, some of them would float their way down on the lands and into people's homes.

And from that day on wards this land came to be known as Meghalay the land of clouds.

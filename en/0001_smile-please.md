# Smile Please!

##
A fawn was racing in the forest.

##
He was ahead of the rabbit.

##
He was ahead of the elephant.

##
He leapt and cleared the stream.

##
He ran past the crumbling wall.

##
There was a large boulder on the grassy plain. He stumbled and fell down.

##
He burst into tears.

##
The monkey massaged his leg. Tears flowed from the fawn's eyes.

##
Brother Bear picked him up. The fawn didn't stop crying.

##
His mother came. She said, “Look, we'll beat up this bad boulder!”

##
The fawn said, “Oh, don't do that or he will also start crying.” His mother laughed. So did the fawn.

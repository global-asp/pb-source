# What If?

##
My name is Shyam, I am ten years old.

I am a little skinny, but very bold!

Waking up for school is no fun at all

I am so sleepy as I get up, I think I will fall.

##
My eyes close as I begin to brush,

I hear Amma making dosas in a rush.

My mind slowly begins to wander away,

And many, many ideas come into play.

##
What if my neck was ten times as long?

Half in school, half at home, where would I belong?

##
What if my legs were as tall as trees?

My school building would only come up to my knees!

##
What if my arms were strong enough?

Then, lifting Amma would not be tough!

##
What if there was nothing too hard for my teeth?

Think of all the things I could eat!

##
What if my belly was as round as could be?

All my friends could jump and bounce off me!

##
What if I had big and floppy ears?

I could hear everything, far and near!

##
What if — I begin, but Amma shouts,

“Shyam, you'll be late, what are you thinking about?”

##
I find myself still standing with my brush in my hand,

And I smile and think of my secret little land.

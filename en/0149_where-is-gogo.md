# Where is Gogo?

##
Toto loved animals. He worked in a zoo.

One day he saw that Gogo, the gorilla's cage was empty.

Toto was shocked. He set off to find him.

##
Gogo must have run towards the jungle, thought Toto.

He looked behind every bush and tree.

The animals in the forest watched Toto.

But Toto could not find Gogo anywhere.

##
Toto whipped out his field glasses.

He scanned the area across the river.

Was Gogo on the other side?

##
Gogo was not to be found.

Toto took a deep breath and dived into the river.

What if Gogo was holding his breath and hiding underwater?

##
Moti, the dog took pity on him.

He barked and looked towards the store nearby.

Ah! Toto finally had a lead.

##
Toto flung open the door of the store.

There was Gogo, happily munching on bananas. What a big mess Gogo had made!

Toto just stared at him, not able to say a word!

Dear Reader,

Would you like to work in a zoo?

What would be the most fun to do, if you worked in a zoo?

How many bananas do you think a gorilla can eat in one sitting?

How many bananas do you eat?

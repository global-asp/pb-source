# When Percy Said Sorry

##
Once upon a time there was a little elephant called Percy, who used to walk carelessly.

He used to step on the ants that lived nearby and injure them endlessly. One-day ants decided to teach him a lesson. They all tickled Percy when he was taking a bath. They tickled Percy when he was eating food. They tickled Percy when he was taking a nap. They tickled and tickled Percy till he said sorry. Percy learned his lesson and never stepped on ants ever again.

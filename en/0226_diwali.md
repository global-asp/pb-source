# Diwali

##
What I do on the day of Diwali:

Hurrraayy its holiday...

I'll wake up early in the morning to take head bath and wear new clothes.

I do Lakshmi Pooja along with my mother and have sweets and savouries.

Evening I'll help my family members in lightning diyas and decorate around my house.

Next I'll fire all my crackers along with my siblings.

Once I am done with my crackers I'll go to my friend's/neighbor's house and again have fun there too.

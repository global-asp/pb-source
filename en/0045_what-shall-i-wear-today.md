# What Shall I Wear Today?

##
Do you get the feeling sometimes that none of your clothes are just right? I do!

##
The shirt buttons trouble me.

The pants feel too tight on me.

##
The lehenga seems to trip me.

The choli does not fit me.

##
My salwar keeps slipping.

The golden zari keeps itching.

##
The churidaar pulls and tugs everywhere.

Nothing perfect seems to be there.

##
This frock is too bright.

Brother's T-shirt? What a funny sight!

##
Papa's kurta is rather long.

Mummy's sari is wrapped all wrong.

Some things are well out of my reach. Oh, it really makes me want to screech!

##
These clothes seem to say, â€˜We shall trouble you all day.'

But I have made up my mind today...

##
... to mix and match these clothes in a way that I have my very own style today!

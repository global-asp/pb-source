# This and That

##
This is Bekku.

And that is me in the mirror.

##
This is what I love to do

... and this is what Bekku likes to do.

##
This is Bekku's favorite place, and that is mine.

When Bekku sees a mouse she runs after it.

##
But if I see a mouse, I run from it.

##
Then when I run after my beeping car, Bekku scoots out through the door ajar.

##
When mamma gives us milk, we both go SLURP, SLURP.

Then follow our loud BURP, BURPS!

##
We like different things - that is very plain.

Our common love for milk, this will always remain!

# Cheenu's Gift

##
School was about to get over. Just five minutes more, but Cheenu could not wait! He looked outside. There was nobody there. From somewhere close by, a bell jingled.

##
“Cheenu, what are you doing?” asked his teacher.

“Sorry Miss,” Cheenu said.

“It's just that...”

##
“Paperwala, kaidalu*! Papere kaidalu!” sang Cheenu's father, the Kabadiwala**. Even from outside, he could see Cheenu's grin.

*Kaidalu: Paper in Telugu, **Kabadiwala: Junk dealer in Hindi.

##
The school bell rang. Cheenu ran out to his father, grinning from ear to ear. He was the only child in school whose father came to pick him up.

##
Cheenu jumped on to the bandi and dangled his legs. His father pushed the bandi*, shouting, “Paperwala... kaidalu!!!”

Cheenu also shouted. They were quite loud! When a watchman stopped them, Cheenu jumped off. He went with his father, carrying an empty sack. All the things they would get today would go into that sack.

*Bandi: Cart in Telugu.

##
From this house, newspapers.

From that one, newspapers and magazines.

From the ground floor, newspapers and magazines and empty bottles.

##
Cheenu ran to the bandi to get another empty sack. They were going up in a lift! Cheenu's eyes grew big and round!

##
From the fifth floor, newspapers and magazines, bottles and boxes and books.

##
While his father was talking to the lady, Cheenu put everything away so that the books were right on top. Where he could look at them!

##
This time, Cheenu had to help his father push the bandi!

##
At home, after they had put everything away, Cheenu's father called him. “I have something for you,” he said.

It was the book Cheenu had been looking at all afternoon!

“Thank you, Naana*!” Cheenu said. After that, they had to call him three times to come and have dinner!

*Naana: Father in Telugu.

# Sam the Dragon

##
Sam the dragon was a flying lighthouse. He showed ships the way back home by breathing out fire.

##
Sam's best friend was called Sar. He was a movie star. He acted in Dragon Breath the movie as a road. But he was not very good at singing.

##
Sam was far away from his parents. He wanted to go home.

##
Toothless was Sam's Doctor. He told Sam to go home to see his parents.

##
Toothless told Sam to follow the square footprints home.

##
On the way home, Sam saw many strange things. Like a Cactus Dragon.

##
He met a girl called Sham. He asked her to help him find his way because he was lost and very sad.

##
She looked at her Dragon Book to look for Sam's parents and find out where they lived.

##
She said 'We have to follow the Dragon Train. Not the square footprints."

##
The Dragon Train went straight to Sam's house. When he saw his father in the sky, Sam felt happy!

##
This is Sam's mother. She is burning food for dinner. She has made Sam's favourite food: pasta.

##
Sam goes back to his job. He is happy now because he has met his parents now.

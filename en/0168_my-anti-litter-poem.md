# My Anti Litter Poem

##
I am smelly, I am dirty!

I never feel guilty!

I cause a lot of pain and acid rain,

stopping me you will have a strain!

I cause malaria in your area,

Causing dengue is fun because it makes you run!

Sea animals die and soon you will cry,

Save your planet, save your earth,

or more diseases soon will take birth

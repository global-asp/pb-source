# Goloo the Circle

##
I am Goloo the circle.

Everyone likes me.

You can find me

everywhere, any time!

##
The sun looks like me.

When it's too hot,

you need an umbrella which also

looks like half of me.

##
At night, the moon

looks like me with a smile.

I look at it through

the owl's round eyes.

##
Huge watermelons, apples, oranges, tomatoes,

even the tiny lemons - all look like me... and mithai!

Juicy rasgullas, syrupy gulabjamuns, lovely laddus...

are among the many sweets that look like me.

##
Animals want me to decorate them.

The cheetah, the chital deer,

have me all over their skin.

I'm there on ladybirds and butterflies too!

##
In the playground,

I'm there as a ball,

a hoopla ring and

many other joyful games!

##
Why, your trucks,

aeroplanes, cars, cycles,

would not be able to move...

if it weren't for me.

##
And yet there is one place where I am not welcome.

On your report card! Sorry friends!

I also feel sad when that happens.

You will have to work hard to change that!

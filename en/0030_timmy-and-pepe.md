# Timmy and Pepe

##
I am Timmy.

This is my friend, Pepe, the puppy.

##
I like to tease Pepe.

I tell him I am better than him.

He does not like it.

##
“Look, I have a nose!” I say.

“Woof,” says Pepe. That means he has a nose too.

##
“Look, I have ears!” I say.

“Woof,” says Pepe. That means he has ears too.

##
“Look, I have eyes!” I say.

“Woof,” says Pepe. That means he has eyes too.

##
“Look, I can dance on my legs!” I say.

“Woof, woof, woof,” says Pepe. That means he has legs too.

##
“Look, I have a tongue!” I say.

“Woof,” says Pepe. That means he has a tongue too.

##
“I can think!” I say.

“Wooooooof,” says Pepe. That means he can think better.

##
“Look I have hands!” I say.

“Grrrrrr...” Pepe says, and turns to show his little tail.

That means he has a tail and I don't have one.

##
But I love Pepe, the puppy and he loves me too.

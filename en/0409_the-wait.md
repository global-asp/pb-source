# The wait

##
Ranjit had been waiting all evening for his parents to return from work. He generally would manage himself from 7pm onwards until 8pm. That is after the nanny has left and he is alone at home waiting for his parents. He was 11 years and thought he could manage himself for an hour by himself. But today he was feeling uneasy. He wanted his mum or dad to be around

##
He was at the window for some time now. Mum would anytime be home. He kept telling it to himself. He was not keen to watch TV; the activity he does when nanny leaves for her home. Dinner was cooked but he was not really hungry. He remembered on his good friend Meenu who would love seeing the stars. She had shown how the sky looked beautiful from her home window. He too was staying in a tall building and his home was on the 19th floor. But all he could stare was traffic, buildings and and city lights.

Meenu was a good friend who helped him in his studies and he liked talking to her. Today she wasn't at her home too. Her mother answered the phone and told him she has gone out to play with the apartment friends.

She asked him if he was alright as Meenu's mum knew he would be alone at home this time. He said he was doing fine and kept the phone. He just wanted someone to be with him in his home.

Just then the door bell rang. His mom was there. Ranjit rushed to hug his mum.

Talking about the nanny and sensing perhaps Ranjit was feeling lonely without company, His mom told him " I will tell Sheela to be here for the next few days until I come or request her to drop you by 6pm to my office. Is that good. Ranjit was feeling about the change and was now smiling. He felt good and post dinner read a lot of stories with his mum and dad. The day ended well.

# My Friends

##
I have many friends.

##
Some of my friends are older and...

##
some of them are younger than me.

##
Some of my friends are old.

##
And some of them are tiny!

##
Some of my friends have tails...

##
Some of my friends have no feet.

##
Some of my friends fly. Some of them swim.

##
Oh! Books are my friends too!

##
But who is my best friend?

Who? Who? Who?

##
My mother!!!

# The Story-Pooping Cat

##
There was once a cat that pooped stories.
She would sit up on a tree without any worries,
Settle down after slurping on curry,
And poop stories, without any hurry.
No, it wasn't the work of elves or fairies;
Just a cat that could poop stories!

##
"My cat doesn't always eat just fish!"

Explained Aaron to his surprised Miss.

"Margaret Mallikarjun Chulli-cat?

She's not one to just laze on a mat...

She finds storybooks, treats them as a dish;

Then? EAT, SLEEP, and PUBLISH!"

##
"I tried it once with a Jack Russell Terrier;

Made him eat some William Shakespeare...

Oh, what a complete and utter disaster,

It just came out a lot smellier!

Margaret Mallikarjun Chulli-cat, there's no one to beat her

When it comes to stories right out of her derriere."

##
"I even tried it with a monkey next door...

(Or was it that annoying boy in Grade Four?)

Well, none of it worked, I can tell you that much,

And not a single story was pooped as such!

It just went nuts, ate everything in the kitchen,

Margaret? Could poop stories even as a kitten!"

##
"So you see Miss, it is a very important matter,

That I have to carry this very long ladder.

My beloved Margaret Mallikarjun Chulli-cat,

I've to bring her down from where she's sat...

When she has published after a long session,

I have to use the ladder, in the interest of our nation!"

##
"What does that have to do with this sum?"

Devidutta-Miss went pale like a dimsum.

She wasn't angry, just petrified...

Quite simply, she was TERRIFIED!

"Thank you for being such a hero,

But in maths you'll score a zero!"

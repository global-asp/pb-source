# Rizwan and his friends having fun in the snow

##
Rizwan, a young kid stayed in a beautiful snow mountain near the Himalayan range.

##
Like him this Saturday morning, the parents finally allowed the other kids who were all his friends to come out and play in the snow.

##
As the sun finally shone like a bright star, the kids Prisha, Arwan, Vinay and Tina all were there creating multiple snowmen. Everyone loved being out there in the snow. They were playing, laughing and singing.

##
The kids knew only those who played in the snow could understand the difference of having fun in the midst of nature. It wasn't about going to a mall or watching TV. This was bliss. They later shared the pictures to all their cousins living in cities to come and enjoy snow like them.

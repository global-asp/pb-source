Once there lived a happy family, they had two children. One was a girl called Mavis in the age of10, the other was a boy called Danim in the age of 8. Mavis is a very intelligent, kind and beautiful girl she loves to play chess with her brother because she always wins against him. while Danim is a very naughty boy how really hated to play chess with his sister and also hated school. Every saturday Danim and Mavis got 10 kr each as pocket money. Mavis put her money into her piggy bank storing it but Danim use to spend it the very second he got his money.

One day asusual Mavis and Danim got there pocket money, Mavis told Danim to store his money too but he refused and said “I will buy a big bar of tasty chocolate!” . On Danim's way to the chocolate shop his money fell out of his hands and rolled into an extremely narrow hole on the road. He put his hand into the hole in hopes of finding his money but he could not find any of his money. Worse than that was his hand got stuck inside the hole! . There was lot of traffic because it was the rush hour, and Danim was very scared that a car might come and crash him.

Then a lot of people huddled around Danim to see what has happened ...some of the people were stout , some were fat and some were extremely thin. As Danim hand was stuck, a sharp pain hit his arm with a clear shot . At that moment a kind-hearted lady entered the crowd. She was very kind and loved to help other people. Then after a little while knowing what she was doing she walked to the front and kneeled beside Danim, the lady said “ I will help you”, Danim said “thank you” .

Then she said to the crowd to call the firetruck so a stout woman who had an Iphone 6 called the fire truck. The lady rubbed butter and soap to Danim's hand while they were They tried and tried but it didn't work then after half an hour, two firefighters showed up. They used a special kind of grease to get Danim's

Hand out of the hole. Danim felt relief about his arm and he was not sad about the chocolate and why should he be? Because the lady who helped him was the owner of the chocolate shop and gave him two big boxes of tasty chocolate.

He liked this experience more than any other experience. He went home very happily and told the whole story to his family. Mavis said “now will you store your money?”and this time Danim said “I will Mavis”. And then they lived happily again.

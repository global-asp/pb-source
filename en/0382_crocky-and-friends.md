# Crocky and friends

##
Crocky the crocodile was sad.

##
He had no friends to play with.

##
Babloo, the butterfly said, "I will play with you, Crocky. Do not cry."

##
Tutoo, the turtle said, "I will play with you, Crocky. Do not cry."

##
Susie, the snake said, "I will also play with you, Crocky. Do not cry."

##
Fred, the frog and Fenny, the fish also came to play.

##
So, Crocky found new friends to play with. He became happy.

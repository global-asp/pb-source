# My best friend and I

##
My name is Neha and my friend's name is Aiyana...

We watch movies, have some snacks, Chit- Chat, paint masks, draw and color,
play instrument, do horse riding, make lollipops, ice-creams, cup-cakes, chocolates, and cookies.

##
One day I called my friend out in the BEAUTIFUL PARK....

We climbed a tall and beautiful tree, and sat on a branch.. Oh I said.. we took some rest. and all

was quiet. A bird came and sat on my hand, we sang a song; flowers started blooming; the sun shined bright; we got fresh air and it felt like MAGIC was surrounding us.

##
It was turning dark. We got down from the tree and we were talking and walking and talking and walking and.... walking and talking and walking and talking. I knew it was my birthday tomorrow but wanted to surprise my friend.

##
I felt happy that she remembered it was my BIRTHDAY. I was filled with joy.

I promised to fulfill her dream too.

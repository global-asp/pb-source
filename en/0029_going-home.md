# Going Home

##
School is over.

Children are leaving.

Teachers are leaving.

Everyone is going home.

##
I come out of the gate.

I am in a hurry.

I do not have time to play.

I do not have time to talk.

I want to get home fast.

##
I walk down the lane.

It is a narrow lane.

I can see crowds up ahead.

There is a big road there.

##
The big road has lots of traffic.

Cars, trucks and cycles, motorcycles, scooters and auto rickshaws.

Some are going this way. Some are going that way.

I know how to find the gap and run to the other side.

##
I have reached the divider.

There is traffic in front.

There is traffic behind.

I must be careful.

##
I am on the other side.

I almost crash into the chanawallah.

He growls. I say, “Sorry,” and run along.

##
I walk faster and faster.

Now there are fish shops. Big fish, small fish, long fish, flat fish.

Shiny fish, dull fish. So many fish in every shop.

##
I walk faster and faster.

Now there are fish shops. Big fish, small fish, long fish, flat fish.

Shiny fish, dull fish, So many fish in every shop.

##
Now I must run.

Past the video shops, past the barber shop,

past the cloth shop, past the pan shop.

Running, running, running down the lane.

##
Finally I reach home.

Oh good! I am not late.

My father goes to work in the afternoon.

He has not left as yet. His cycle is still here.

##
My father comes outside, my mother is behind him.

I give my father a big hug. My father gives me a big hug.

Then he goes to work. Now there is no hurry. I have lots of time.

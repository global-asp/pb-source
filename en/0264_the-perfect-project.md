# The perfect project

##
What should I do for my project?Dia stared at the the birds on the mango tree.

##
Suddenly, Amma called Dia and Pradeep to eat lunch. The sweet smell of Gujia's, Dokhla and Thepla gave Dia an idea.

##
Dia thought about doing her project on" The India Gate."

##
Or "The Desert's of Rajasthan".

##
Or "The Dancing Peacok of Mysuru."

##
But she did'nt know what to choose. So she asked Dadhi for help.

##
Dadhi told Dia to do her project on" Diwali". So Dia agreed.

##
So when Dia submitted her project in class, everyone clapped their hands. Mrs Shamena, her class teacher asked her from where did she get such a wonderful project. Dia replied that her Dadhi had given her the idea. It was a wonderful project.

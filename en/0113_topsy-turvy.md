# Topsy Turvy

##
I do not know why I woke up very early today

Soon I saw that it was a strange new day!

##
Nothing at all was as it really should be

And I could hear someone shouting loudly at me!

##
Our cot had climbed right up the wall

And my little clock had grown very tall!

##
Our umbrella was twirling madly round and round

My red and blue cap was making a clicking sound!

##
What on earth has happened to our little room?

I fear I am going to faint very soon!

##
The fan has turned into a big octopus

My sister's doll is eating dal and rice without a fuss.

##
Our cat is sitting up in Papa's chair

And look! A mouse is reading the news on the air!

##
In the mirror - Aah! See! I am seven feet high!

I know I am going to loudly cry!

##
But now look! Here comes a magic man

“Sorry! Sorry!” he says, “I will do what I can!”

##
“Yes, yes! It was I who made this little mess

It was not so nice of me, I do confess!”

##
So Abra-ca-da-dabra chin chin choo!

Room! Get back in order - one - three - two!

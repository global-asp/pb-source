# Oh the Way We Ran, in the Fish Rain

##
Dark clouds gathered over the hills as Akira was leaving home on a windy day.

"Don't forget to get our umbrella from Gopu's shop. It looks like it's going to rain," said Akira's father. But just as Akira and Zero - her pet cat - started to walk towards the rusty old bridge, it began to rain...

##
... FISH!

An endless stream of fish was falling from the sky.

Thin fish, fat fish, blue fish, golden fish, upside down fish, slanting fish - oh, hundreds and hundreds of falling fish!

But Akira couldn't be late. So they ran and ran, in the fish rain.

##
Across Kabir's fields they sprang, with the wind howling in their ears and a strong fishy smell tickling their noses.

But they couldn't be late. So they ran and ran, in the fish rain...

##
Until Akira noticed that Zero was no longer with her. But it wasn't hard to find him.

"Stay with me, Zero. You know I can't be late today," she said.

So they ran and ran, in the fish rain.

##
Soon they reached the market street. People were holding their baskets high to catch as many falling fish as possible. "Fish for sale! Fresh, fresh fish for sale!" The market was already filled with their loud, excited cries, and it made Akira and Zero feel just a little hungry.

But they couldn't be late. So they ran and ran, in the fish rain...

##
Until, all of a sudden, fish stopped falling from the sky.

Slowly, the clouds parted, and there it was - a grand, smiling rainbow.

Akira jumped with joy and reached out to the sky.

They had reached school just in time. And finally, no more running in the fish rain!

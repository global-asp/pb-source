One day owl went out to search for food.

She met Mr. Bat and asked him if he wanted to join her.

Mr. Bat agreed. While they were searching baby bat also joined them.

##
They couldn't find any food but they saw a plate full of food.

All of them ate their fill and ran away.

The food was of an woodcutter. He was angry when his food was not there. He could never find out who took it!

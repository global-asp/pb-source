# Colours of Nature

##
I see a blue butterfly waving goodbye

##
I see a yellow bee drinking a cup of tea

##
I see a red fish in a dish

##
I see a green frog playing with a puppy dog

##
I see an orange duck

wishing me good luck

##
I see a violet flower

dancing with a caterpillar

##
I see a grey and black cat

wearing an orange hat

##
I see a grey and brown mouse

hiding in a pink house

##
I see a red and black fox

wearing purple socks

##
I see a green grasshopper reading a

black and white newspaper

##
I see a black and purple goat

sailing in a red boat

##
I see a green and brown crocodile

giving me a big smile

##
I see a black and blue snake

eating a slice of cake

##
I see a red and yellow hen

writing with a pen

##
I see a black and orange tiger

standing in the water

##
I see with my two black eyes

all the colours as they fly

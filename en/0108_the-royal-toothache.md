# The Royal Toothache

##
The lion was the king of the jungle.

Everyone shivered and shook when he roared.

##
He had a terrible toothache since two days.

“Maharaj, get this tooth extracted,” suggested the monkey, the jungle physician.

“Alright,” agreed the lion.

##
Who would extract the lion's tooth? They were all terrified of him!

“Maharaj, I will give you a kick with my hind legs. The tooth will pop out,” said the foolish donkey.

##
“You will dare to kick the king?” roared the lion peevishly.

The donkey tucked his tail between his legs and ran off.

##
The elephant, cheetah, bear and deer were all worried.

Who would stick their hand into the lion's mouth?

##
Two days passed. The toothache was getting unbearable.

“Should I take a look?” asked the mouse one night when the lion and he were alone.

“Alright,” said the lion and opened his mouth wide.

##
“Oh! There is a lot of dirt trapped between your teeth!” said the mouse taking a peek inside. Using his sharp teeth, he cleaned out the lion's teeth. The lion felt much better.

##
“Maharaj, please clean your teeth everyday, or else your teeth will rot,” said the wise little mouse.

##
“Yes, you are right. But please don't tell anybody or they will say their king doesn't keep clean...” pleaded the lion.

##
"Alright," laughed the mouse.

##
The lion also laughed.

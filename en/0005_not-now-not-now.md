# Not Now, Not Now!

##
I asked Ajji, “May I please have some laddoos?”

“Not now, beta, maybe tomorrow.”

But I did not want to wait till tomorrow.

##
I asked Ajja, “May I go out to play with my friends?”

“Not now, beta. Maybe after your nap?”But I did not want to wait till after my nap.

##
I asked Ma, “May I wear these new clothes?”

“Not now, beta, you can wear them when we go out.” But I did not want to wait till we went out.

##
I asked Papa, “May I open that nice

looking box?”

“Not now, not now. You must wait.”

But I did not want to wait any more.

##
Why do big people always say,

‘Not now, not now'?

That night, I went to sleep feeling angry.

##
The next day, I woke up early and went into the kitchen. Ajji said, “You can eat these laddoos now.”

##
Ajja said, “We can play cricket now.”

Ma said, “You can wear these clothes now.”

Papa said, “You can open this box now.” And they all said, “Happy birthday!”

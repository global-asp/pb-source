In a forest, there lived a rat by name Moti and his friend Mohan, an elephant. They eat and play together. One day Mohan got trapped in a net. Mohan cried loudly. On hearing Mohan's voice Moti ran to help. Moti started cutting the net with its sharp teeth. Slowly Mohan was able to come out of the net. Mohan thanked Moti for saving his life and they lived happily forever.

# Do and Don't

##
Good Morning!

Time to wake up.

##
I DON'T want to wake up!

I DON'T want to do the big job!

##
I DON'T want to brush my teeth!

I DON'T want to have a bath!

I DON'T want to have idlis for breakfast!

##
I DON'T want to go to school!

##
Hmm...

But, today's your class picnic at the zoo!

##
I DO like idlis with sugar!

I DO want to go to school!

I DO like singing while I take a bath!

I DO want to use my new tooth brush!

##
Oops! This is urgent!

I DO want to go for the big job!

Here I come, like a rocket... DO please give way,

DON'T stand in my way!

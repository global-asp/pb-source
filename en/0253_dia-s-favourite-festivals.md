Holi

It's holi!There is a lot of cheer around India. Me and my family are getting ready to celebrate holi.

We wear ethenic clothes on this day. We play holi on an empty ground. We spray colour water on each other.

After we finished spraying water, and after the celebrations are over, we distribute sweets and samosas to the neighbours.

Me and my family enjoy holi. Do you?

Dussehera

On dussehera, me and my family buy dolls and make a *golu. We make vadas, paysam, sweets and dry rice.

I help my grandmother make the food. Then, me and my mother go and invite people who we know to see the golu.

In the night, we give sweets to the people who we invited.

I like dussehera. Do you?

##
Onam

On onam, we make a rangoli out of jasmine and other coloured flowers. Me and my family go to Kerala to celebrate onam.

We first go to my cousins house and then we start making the rangoli. After we finished, we go and watch the boat race.

The boat race is held near the islands. After the boat race is over, we rent a boat and go for a row.

I love onam. Do you?

##
Diwali

Diwali is creeping close!On this wonderful festival, the whole of India will be filled with light.

In english, Diwali is called" the festival of lights". We light diya's and burn crackers on this day.

We wear non-synthitic clothes to not get burnt. We make sweets, vada's and pongal. We distribute sweets to the neighbours.

I enjoy Diwali. Do you?

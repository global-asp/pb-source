# The little girl and Teddy

##
A little girl got Teddy Bear and a Barbie doll on her birthday. Her friends gifted her toys. From that day she is playing with that Teddy bear and the Barbie. After coming from school she takes the Teddy bear and gives it a Flying kiss . Then her mother saw this practice and one day her mother stopped her by saying why are you doing that. O! Mummy this is my favorite teddy and this is my favorite Barbie. Can't I give them a flying kiss. Then mother told you can but you should give them a proper wash before playing them.

The little girl did not follow what her mother asked her to do. Next day, After coming from school she slept and her mother throwed away both the toys. When she got up and started looking for the toys, could not find them. Then her mother asked what are you searching for. I am searching for my two toys then her mother told her when you were sleeping I throwed them away as they are very dirty.

Then the little girl asked her mother to buy two new toys, as she missed both her favorite toys. My dear daughter, be ready by 5 0'clock. We will go to exhibition for rides, to play games and to the toys shop in the end, before starting for home. Then the girl and mother went as planned and brought food items and Toys – Rabbit, Tiger and a Turtle. From then on, the little girl kept her toys neat and tidy.

Then her mother told you are my lovely and favorite daughter in the whole world. She asked why is it so mom, and mother told you kept your promise and doing your home work regularly and keeping your books and toys very neat and your teachers are told me you are behaving very well in the school and you got very good marks in Quarterly exams.

Now I am going to give surprise, saying this, her mother gave her a new Teddy bear and a Barbie doll set t-ind�%� �

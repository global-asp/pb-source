# Little Blue Alien

##
On a red Planet far far away

Our little blue Alien lost his way

With four legs and three little fingers in his hand

All he was left with, was a Magic Wand

##
And with his magic wand, however hard he tried

To make his new red planet full of colors green, blue or even white

All that he could do was create only stars, although bright

But with flowers and trees in his mind, he felt nothing was going right

##
Alone and exhausted, he became so sad

To find a way out, he scratched his head

Suddenly, there crossed our Astronaut in his speedy Jet

And he saw our little blue Alien sitting alone in a planet so red

##
And the astronaut stopped by

To say a little "Hi"

To our little blue Alien

Who was excited to finally see a companion

##
Our little blue alien told the Astronaut

That how he is stuck alone and lost

"Please take me along

To the place you belong

I hear the Earth is a colorful place

Where there are trees and grass and flowers to embrace"

##
The Astronaut happily agreed to take our Little Blue Alien to Earth, the beautiful planet

And excited, together they boarded the speedy Jet

Through the stars and the moon and the cloud

Hustled back the Jet to the Earth making sounds so loud

##
Our little blue Alien smiled and danced seeing the colorful sight

The flowers, the trees everything so beautiful and bright

And he had also made a wonderful friend

Happy he was, that everything was good in the end.

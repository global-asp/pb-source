# River and Sun

##
River and Sun were best friends.

Each morning they met each other with a gurgle and a giggle. As the Sun went across the sky, the River would go about her work. Both talked to each other all the time.

##
One very hot day River was exhausted.

All day animals and fish and children had asked her for help.

##
First the fish asked her, 'Nadi mausi, please take us till the shady place near the trees. It's too hot here and we are very tired.'

So the river flowed gently towards the shady place near the trees, and the fish were able to rest.

##
Then the children arrived.

'Nadi mausi, it is so hot! Can we jump and play in your cool water?'

River was tired but she said to them, 'Sure.'

##
Then the animals came.

'Nadiji, adaab. How are you today? It is so hot! We've come to drink water earlier because we are so thirsty.'

'Adaab, my friends. Please have a drink. You must have come from very far.'

##
River was tired now. Just then Sun called out teasingly, 'Nadi mausi, no time for me today!'

River was not in the mood for jokes.

'Mausi? I'm not your mausi! Don't bug me. All day I have to do this and that and then you have the cheek to call me mausi!'

##
Baap re! Sun got a start.

'Array! I'm just pulling your leg. Why are you so snappy?'

River got angry. 'Snappy! You can't see how much I've been working!' Saying this, she turned away.

##
Sun was surprised. She quickly went behind some light clouds.

She watched River and saw that she was moving slowly now - as if she was really tired. She realised it had been a hard day.

##
Later, River called out, 'Sun. I'm sorry. Did you feel very bad?'

Sun came out from behind the cloud. 'No yaar! But you never scold me, so I was a little scared. From now on I'll be very respectful of you.' Saying this, Sun giggled.

River gurgled. 'You! Respectful! Ha ha! We'll see!'

##
From that day, whenever Sun has to rise in the morning, she does so slowly. First she sends some light into the sky to gently wake River. Then she peeps out.

'Psst', she says to River. 'May I come out now?'

'Ha ha', gurgles River. 'As if you need my permission.'

##
Through the day, these two friends talk, following each other through the world.

And at the end of the day, the Sun says, 'Good Night mataji' to the River and they both laugh at the joke.

Even today, they are best friends.

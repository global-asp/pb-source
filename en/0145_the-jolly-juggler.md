# The Jolly Juggler

##
There was once a lady of 89, who loved juggling. Well, guess what? She juggled with donkeys, books, toys and everything she would find. Isn't that crazy? Yesterday she did this, I'll tell you about that day. It all started on a Sunday morning at 6 o'clock. She dreamed that: she went to her great grand son's class and juggled with everything. OMG did she laugh! But there was a problem, she wanted to make the dream true! OH No! Shouted her husband when he heard the news. Her husband was 91 years old. When she went to drop her great grand son, she asked him: My dear child, could I come to your school today? Her great grandson got scared....... He also knew about his great grandmom. But what could he do? So he said ok she was overjoyed to hear that I love you she said. After they reached OH what a drama happened, this is what happened: she juggled with books, toys etc when the teacher came, she saw that every one was crying.

What happened? she asked. All the children whined and said: SHE and pointed at her.

What happened aunty? She asked to his great grandmom. I juggled with their stuff she said. Ooh so that's the thing said the teacher. The teacher said: If you like juggling, why don't you juggle for us on our annual day? asked the teacher. Sure she said, but for now I will get chocolates for them.

THE END

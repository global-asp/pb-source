# Shyamlal, your work!

##
Shyamlal came home wearing headphones and smiling, while he was listening to the latest songs launched. His wife was ready with dinner and his kids were there eagerly waiting for bed time since Shyamlal would tell wonderful tales about the great Tenali Ram. Today there was a special dinner, Ma's (Mother) amazing Pongal, Sambar with Shyamlal's favouite vegetables, Steaming rice and delicious curd with pieces of pomegranate.

##
Suddenly Shyamlal remembered that he had to pay the moneylender , Give the carpenter back his hammer, Buy a new measuring tape for the tailor and buy his wife some rose flowers for the garden! Shyamlal did not remind his wife about anything, he quietly just sat down and started to eat. After some time Shyamlal forgot about everything and calmed down. He was as cool as a cucumber after an hour.

##
In the morning, First he went to the moneylender...................

##
Next he went to the carpenter...............

##
Then to the tailor............

##
Finally to the bazaar............

##
And then to Home, Home, Home!.........

##
Shyamlal's work is done now at last he can rest. Poor Shyamlal! He had a load of work to do. Shyamlal is busy, to be specific, he is always too busy. Watch out Shyamlal or one day you will be in great trouble! Always remember to do your work in time or else you will suffer like Shyamlal Babu.

# The Indigo Fairy and the Water Buffaloes

##
The dandelion landed on a grassy river bank.

For such a truly wonderful sight,
Kian, the Indigo Fairy,
wondered who he could thank!!

##
As Kian went to give the baby buffalo a cuddle, he found himself in a puddle.

Off went the calf with the teeth, into the water, his mother to meet!

Dear Fairy, if in this herd, you want to make a friend,
sitting silently, peace and love out you send... said the Buffalo herder.

##
As Kian's meditation went deep, out of the water, the buffaloes started to creep.

The breath moves in...the breath moves out...

The dust begins to settle down, clarity of mind can be found.

With the mind clear, Kian begins to feel. Like an onion, the layers begin to peel...

Peace arises...Love starts to flow...

Kian is enveloped by a special glow...

##
Kian decided to lie down,
when he woke up this is what he found.

Once again he was in a puddle,
but this time it was because
the wet buffaloes wanted a cuddle!

##
The new friends started to play...

Kian showed the buffaloes how to play ring a ring of roses...

##
The Buffaloes showed Kian their favourite game of blowing bubbles...

##
When they got tired, they played a game they had all enjoyed;
Sitting silently together, they generated a loving vibe!

##
Adventure calls “Whee whee whee”
Dandelion in hand, Kian climbs up a tree.

Kian thought while waiting for a gust of wind...

“Today I learnt that sometimes in life being polite,
means simply not doing anything that gives others a fright.”

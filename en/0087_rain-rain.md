# Rain, Rain

##
A cloud rolled along merrily in the sky.

##
The peacock said, “Why don't you rain? I will dance for you.”

##
The fish said, "Please rain. I need more water."

##
The farmer said, “Please rain. I'll plant seeds for the next crop.”

##
Raju said, “If you rain, I'll sail paper boats.”

##
The cloud rained in a shower of shimmering drops.

##
The peacock spread its pretty feathers and danced.

##
The pond filled up. The fish was happy.

##
The farmer started planting seeds.

##
Splish! Splash! Splosh! Raju and his friends had a wonderful time in the puddles.

##
The cloud filled everybody's heart with joy. It moved on. All the children waved goodbye.

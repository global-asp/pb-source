# Why, Oh Why!

##
Eyes are red.

##
Why, oh why?

##
Nose just runs. Wipe it dry.

##
Cheeks feel hot. Touch me not!

##
Throat is sore. No water nearby!

##
Mouth goes round. Why, oh why?

##
Air all gone.

##
Why, oh why?

##
Now, what shall we do?

##
Use the thread. Tie the balloon.

##
You blow the balloon. Your turn now.

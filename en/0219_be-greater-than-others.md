# Be greater than others

##
In a zoo, there were different animals and lion was the head of all the animals. The Lion said, I can do many things than others. Then all animals got angry and called up for a running race to see who is fastest and fit to be a king. Curator also came as participant and told he can run faster than other animals. Next day they kept a running race and animals started to run towards winning post. The first animal which reached winning post is Rhino, which is fit to be a king of zoo.

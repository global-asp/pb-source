# Manya's perfect dress

##
Manya was getting ready for a party. But she did'nt know what to wear.

##
She tried every t-shirt and pant she had. She still could not find the perfect dress.

##
She tried her new frock and her t-shirt. She felt it was not nice.

##
She tried on a t-shirt and a pant. They were too loose.

##
She tried on her t-shirt with a poncho tied around her hip. Still not perfect.

##
She took a green t-shirt and a pant. But they were too tight.

##
She tried on her frock. But it was too long.

##
Manya was tired. She did'nt know what to wear. She suddenly stared out of her window, her eyes falling in her chudidhar. At first , she did'nt think about the dress. She wore the dress to the party. Manya had finally found the perfect dress.

# I Am Not Afraid!

##
I am a big girl. I go out of the house alone.

##
It is so dark! Is someone there? Who is it?

##
Oh, it is only the cat. I am not afraid.

##
I can see a big dark thing outside! What is it?

##
Oh, it is only the well. I am not afraid.

##
And that sound! Creak creak creak! What is it?

##
Only my sister drawing water from the well! I am not afraid.

##
I hear footsteps! Who is it? Who is it?

##
It is my mother. She has come home from the fields.

##
I am a big girl now.

##
I am not afraid of anything!

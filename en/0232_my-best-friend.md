# My best friend

##
My best friend lives with me. When I look in the mirror, she looks at me.

##
When I am happy, she is too.

##
When I am sad, she is too.

##
Me and my friend play all day long until we are tired.

##
We play in my dream when I am asleep.

##
Me and my friend live together forever.

# Nanni's Birthday Gift

##
It was Nanni's Dodappa's birthday eve. Everyone in the house were busy making preparations for his birthday and our little Nanni was busy chatting with her Dodappa. "Dodappa, what gift would you like to have for your birthday?" Do you want a new shirt? A red car? or a big chocolate? Dodappa smiled and replied "Nanni, I have all of that."

Nanni thought and thought, what can I give Dodappa that is special, something that he does not have? Nanni shouted with her eyes wide open "Dodappa, I know what gift I will give you." Dodappa asked curiously "What Nanni?". "I will gift you hair on your head for your birthday" answered Nanni proudly to her balding Dodappa.

Dodappa said, "Now that sounds like a great gift, but how will you gift me hair on my head Nanni? Nanni immediately replied "I Know Dodappa I will colour your head with my crayons and it will look like hair". Dodappa with a naughty grin on his face said "Oh! Nanni, but that will wash off when I have a bath". Nanni said "Hmmm.... then I will buy a wig from the market for you". Dodappa noded his head side ways and said "Sorry Nanni, I do not like the idea of a wig either".

Nanni was thinking hard now how could she gift Dodappa "hair" on his birthday? Nanni with a serious look on her face replied "I will cut some of my hair and stick it on your head ". Dodappa said "That is sweet of you Nanni, but I would like to have my own hair on my head". Nanni pondered and said "Dodappa, Dodappa, you know what, I got an idea. I will cut your moustache hair and plant it on your head".

"Just like Amma, Amma plants the little plants in our garden which after some time grows into big trees ". Dodappa had a hearty laugh HA HA HA... still laughing he said "Nanni, your thought of giving me a headfull of hair - that is the funniest birthday gift I have ever got. Thank you my dear Nanni".

Will Dodappa's hair grow then? Nanni is still wondering. What would you do to grow Dodappa's hair back?

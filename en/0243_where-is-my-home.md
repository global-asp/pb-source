# Where is my Home?

##
Once upon a time all animals of jungle thought to had a urgent meeting. The agenda of meeting was continuous cutting of trees by man because of that animals are short of space. Mr. Elephant started the meeting. Mr. Elephant," I am worried about my coming generations , oh! Where they will have shelter if these MEAN HUMANS will continue to cut down our natural habitats." Yeah yeah we agree said all the animals together.

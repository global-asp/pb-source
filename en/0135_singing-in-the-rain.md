# Singing in the Rain

##
Sukhiya Kaka lived in a village called Bitauna. Bitauna was famous all over Rajasthan for its singers. No celebration was complete without Sukhiya Kaka's sweet songs.

Today he had been invited to village Jhalaura.

##
Sukhiya Kaka twirled his big moustache and set off.

He was singing raag Malhar.

... Come to me o rolling clouds...

##
Suddenly, he heard, dhupp dhupp dhupp dhupp!

Was someone giving a beat to his song?

Dinoo, the dinosuar came running towards him. Sukhiya Kaka was so happy to see him!

##
You don't get such a BIG listener every day!

... Come to me o rolling clouds, shower me with lovely rain!

Sukhiya Kaka and Dinoo sang a duet and did a little jig to keep time.

##
The clouds just had to listen to them!

Lightning flashed and the wind danced. Dark clouds came rolling in.

Sukhiya Kaka and Dinoo laughed with joy.

##
As the rain came pouring down, Sukhiya Kaka and Dinoo shared a small umbrella. Then off they went to Jhalaura following the smell of yummy pakoras, singing

... O thank you for the lovely rain... O..la la la.

Dear Reader,

Have you ever seen a dinosaur?

Do you think they would have sung songs?

What do you like to do in the rain?

What do you like to eat when it rains?

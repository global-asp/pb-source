# Cheep Cheep Drip Drip

##
It's hard to be still,

it's hard to be quiet.

##
It's hard to say no,

to toes that wiggle so.

##
It's hard to keep down

these merry feet,

##
When sounds all around tap a happy beat.

Cheep, cheep, cheep call the sparrows.

##
Drip, drip, drip goes the tap.

##
SHEE... SHEEEE...

##
SHEE... sings the cooker.

##
Crunch, crunch, crunch...

... uh oh, I know what that is!

##
“Why little one, have you wandered so far, away from your books, your toys and your cars? Why indeed? There's nothing here to hear or to see.”

##
I look up at mamma. I look in surprise. Can she not see?

Can she not hear? The cheep, the drip, the sheee...

##
... and the crunch? A world full of sounds, all waiting to be found?

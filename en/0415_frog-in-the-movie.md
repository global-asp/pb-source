One day, Raju, Dimpy and Pinky went to watch a movie. They were very happy to finish their exams and were waiting to go for a movie. When they heard about Jungle Raja movie, they were very happy.

When they were watching the movie, instead of hearing the tiger's roar, they were hearing a frogs's croaking noise. They were wondering what happened to the mighty tiger. They were curios. And suddenly they see Sharma uncle jumping off his seat screaming. And alas, what they see? A on his seat. All burst out laughing.

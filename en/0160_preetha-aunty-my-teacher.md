# Preetha Aunty- My teacher

##
This is Preetha Aunty. She teaches us Hindi.

We began with the letters, now we have finished up till 'dda'.

##
Preeta aunty tells us one or two words with the letters.

Ka se Kamal, Ka se kalam, Ka se Kutta.

Aunty drew the lotus and the pen. But she did not know how to draw the dog.

So I drew it for her!

##
It is my birthday, I am very happy.

I got chocolates for all my friends and teachers.

##
I gave a chocolate to Preetha Aunty.

She told me "Dhanyawaad"

I also said Dhanyawaad because I did not know how to say" Welcome" in Hindi.

Do you?

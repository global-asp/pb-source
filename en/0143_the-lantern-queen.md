# The Lantern Queen

##
I parked myself right under the big orange lantern and asked, “Do I look like a Lantern Queen?”
I waited for exactly three minutes. To my dismay, no one replied.
Rajjo was really busy in a deep conversation. “Rajjo, Rajjo, Rajjo, Rajjo!” I yelled.
She finally tore away from the deep discussion and looked at me.
“Do I look like a lantern queen?” I asked, again.
“You're mad.” said Rajjo. She looked away and promptly got back to her seemingly important discussion.
I now turned to Shriya. Surprisingly she was already staring at me. “Can you see how I'm letting that question just pass?” she said with her sharp eyebrow raised.
Sigh! The life of a Lantern Queen is going to be difficult; I thought and looked at Shruti.
Shruti was also already staring at me. But she had an I-am-observing-you look all over her face. After a close examination she finally said, “You look more like you have a jelly fish on your head.”
“So, I'm the Jelly Fish Queen?” I asked.
“Not a queen really...” said Shruti.
“So a layperson with a jelly fish on the head?” I confirmed.

“Yes.” she said.
“Oh! Okay.” I said and sat down.
What does Shruti know about the Lantern Queen, I thought.
They are all jealous. They don't want to acknowledge the fact that I am now the Lantern Queen.
It had to be! It is not every day that a huge lantern appears right about your head.
It had to mean something. And I knew exactly what it meant. Only these guys were being oblivious to the facts.
I decided that I had to leave for the day. I now had the responsibility of being the Lantern Queen.
I looked at my watch and saw it was almost 6.00 in the evening. So I started packing up.

I knew being the Lantern Queen was not going to be easy. I had to open up my mind and think profound thoughts. I had to let the light come in.
As I walked to the station, I saw a lady running behind a taxi. This was a rather common site in the mad Mumbai city.
But today, I pushed myself to look beyond the obvious and find the real meaning hidden behind this scene. What am I missing? There had to be something, I thought.
Think like the Lantern Queen! I told myself.
Then, out of nowhere, it came to me. I figured that running behind anything in life was a complete waste of energy. Running behind marks as a student, behind money as an adult, was all futile.
So, I took a conscious call. If the thing I want can walk with me at my pace, then it's going to be worth the effort. If I have to keep running behind something, then it is simply not going to be sustainable. For how long will I keep running?
And anyways, I didn't enjoy running much.
After this great analysis, I felt really enlightened. I had opened up my mind and this role-play was now becoming really interesting.
So with a spring in my step, I marched on towards the station.

I was carefully looking left to cross the road when a cabbie came by in full speed and splashed a whole lot of muck over my jeans.
If this were yet another day, I would have started running behind the cabbie while showering him with all the curse words I knew of.
But today, I kept my cool. I let him go and thought, why did this happen?
This time, the bulb in my head didn't go on. So, I did the most fun thing I could do in that moment. I walked right into that puddle of muck and jumped up and down till my whole top was dirty as well.
By the time I was out, I saw a million eyes staring at me. But, I didn't feel embarrassed. I was now the Lantern Queen, and they didn't know that the Lantern Queen could do anything.

I picked up my pace once again and walked towards the station.
Once I got onto my platform, I saw the most miraculous sight. Slowly pulling in was a 12-coach train that was completely empty!
For a city dweller, this situation is worthy of great emotions. I could feel a surge of emotions swell in me. I was elated beyond words.
I promptly stepped into the train and made myself comfortable for the ride back home.
Train journeys back home were my most favourite part of the day. I could feel the stress release my system. This was also my thinking time.
And so, I put my thinking cap on.
I pondered on what would the Lantern Queen do in this valuable free time?
I didn't have to think too long, as a fellow passenger soon gave me the answer by throwing a bag full of garbage out of the window.
I gently got up and sat next to that lady and told her, “Aunty, please don't throw things out of the window.”
“Why not?” she asked almost confused.
“Cause it can result in the spread of many diseases, aunty! If you have thrown some kind of food, then it will encourage the rodents and rats on the tracks. It is not at all hygienic.” I said.

“Is it? I didn't think of the outcome when I threw the bag outside. I have seen everyone do it, so I do it out of habit now.” explained the lady.
“Now you know better, no? So next time please wait till the platform comes? There are dustbins there!” I said.
“Okay, I will listen to you young lady. We must change with the times.” said the aunty.
We both exchanged really wide smiles and I felt really proud of myself.
I was shaken out of my thoughts when I heard the voice of the announcer announcing that the next destination was my station.
I dusted my outfit a little and got up.
The Lantern Queen now had to face her mother. This I knew was going to be a tough one.

After a quick auto ride from station to home, I found myself standing outside the door of my house.
I was a little worried now. My clothes were costly. I didn't want to be greeted by an angry mother.
So again, I forced myself to think like the Lantern Queen. And the bulb in my head did flicker, but it came right on.
I quickly rummaged my bag for the house key. I knew I had it in there somewhere. Soon enough, I found it.
I opened the door and ran into my room. “Hi Maa! I'm home,” I yelled as I crossed my parent's room.
By the time my mom came to see what was up, I was safely inside my bathroom.
“What are you doing inside?” enquired a suspicious mother.
“Ma! I am taking a bath!” I yelled.
“Why?” continued the suspicious mother.
“Because I feel like it Ma! I'm all sweaty.”
“Okay. I will see you at the dinner table. Be quick.” she ended.
I knew well that she was not convinced. Mothers have this instinct. They just know everything.
But this time I had escaped because I was the Lantern Queen. I washed my clothes squeaky clean and realised that a mistake is not really a mistake if one can undo it.
When I came out, mom was at the table.

She had made hot soup with fried bread.
I was so hungry that I gulped down two bowl-fulls.
By the end of it all, my full stomach was making me really drowsy.
“Can I go to sleep, ma?” I asked her.
“Are you sure everything is fine? Don't you want to share some office gossip today?” she asked.
“Yes ma! All is fine! I promise. I'm just sleepy.” I said.
“Fine, go to sleep. But you have to catch-up with me tomorrow.” she said before I pecked her on the cheek and headed straight to bed.

When I felt the warmth of the sun on my face, I knew it was morning.
I opened my eyes and saw that I was up much before the alarm.
This came as a pleasant surprise.
I felt like a true queen in her chamber. I got off the bed with great grace and poise.
I decided I will wear the royal purple and picked out my clothes from the wardrobe.
In no time, I was ready.
I went to my parent's room to find both of them happily chatting away over a cup of tea.
“Good morning from the queen!” I announced before I walked in.
“But aren't you our princess?” asked dad puzzled.
“Dad, I am multitasking!” I replied.
“Ahh, ok your highness.” replied dad.
With dad, it was always like this. No questions asked. Just go with the flow.
I had a quick cup of tea with them discussed the beautiful weather. As soon I was done with my cup, I took off for work.
The Lantern Queen was never late, I knew that.

My journey to work went as smooth as my morning. It flowed like a calm stream of the river. No jerks, no breaks, no peaks, no falls. No extremes.
I reached office a little before time. I punched-in and walked towards my team. With an air of superiority, I went and sat at my desk.
I put on the computer and looked up at my lantern.
What I saw now, shook me.
The lantern was gone! It was gone?
I didn't understand the meaning of this. I stood up to see where it had moved.
I stared at the receptionist with great anger. My lantern was right above her head.
“Who did that?” I asked Shruti, pointing towards the lantern.
“Must be of office boys. They are the ones in charge of the Diwali decorations, no? They must have moved it.”
“But, it was right above my head yesterday!” I complained.
“Yes, but now it is above the reception desk where everyone can see it and feel the Diwali feel!” said Shruti putting some sense in the discussion.
I turned away from her and sat down.
This was very upsetting. Was I the Lantern Queen just for a day? I didn't want to stop being the Lantern Queen. I was enjoying each and every minute of it.

This was depressing. There had to be a way out.
“Purvi, will you please come here?” called out my editor.
Like an obedient zombie, I got up and walked towards her desk.
“You know we are coming up with our Diwali Special issue, right?” she asked
“Yes ma'am.” I replied.
“So here is something that is going to make your day brighter. You have to come up with a fictional character and its story. We will carry this as a continuing series in the magazine till Diwali. This character has to talk about the festivities that are seen in the city right before the actual festival. Like a build-up, you know?”
My mind was racing now. “Yes, I get it.”
“This is quite a big opportunity for an intern, Purvi. You are getting it because the rest of the team has their hands full already. And if you get this right, we might consider you for a permanent employee too.” said my editor.
“Ma'am, umm, uh, err. Can this character be called the Lantern Queen?” I asked with all hope.
My editor fell silent for a few seconds. I could feel my heart beat pick up. I was sure it was audible to everyone else too now.
“Lantern Queen?” she asked,

“Hmm. Okay, that does have a ring to it. Quickly write your character sketch and treatment and send it across to me. Let's get this working.” she concluded.
What! Did I just hear that right? This had to be the best day of my life!
It was right then I realised that, by appearing above my head the previous day, the lantern had changed something. Its light had touched me and transformed me for life. It had ensured that I could not only be the Lantern Queen forever, but also write about it publically!
Somewhere deep down inside, I just knew this was my very own big break.
This Diwali was going to be full of lights, laughter and happiness.

The End

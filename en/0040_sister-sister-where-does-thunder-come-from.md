# Sister, Sister, Where Does Thunder Come From?

##
Sister, sister I wonder...

What do you wonder, little brother,

What do you wonder?

I wonder, I wonder,

Where thunder comes from.

Where do you think, little brother,

Where do you think?

I think, I think

Tell me, little brother,

What do you think?

##
I think

That there is a great big Kumbhakarna

Sleeping in the sky

And when the silver ropes of rain

Lash him, and chase his sleep away,

He wakes up.

Sparks fly out of his eyes like lightning

He stamps his big ugly feet

Takes a long deep breath

And ROARS with rage.

##
(Let me tell you If I had thrown a tantrum like that Mother would have spanked me.

Hard.)

I think that's

Where the thunder comes from

From the fury of a

Kumbhakarna in the sky

Who likes to stay asleep, and dry.

I'm clever, aren't I, sister?

##
Oh yes you are, little brother, oh yes you are.

And maybe you're right, too...

But in the books that I have read

That is not what they said.

Then what did they say, sister,

What did they say?

What do you think, little brother,

What do you think?

I think, I think...

Tell me, little brother, What do you think?

##
I think

There is a gang of crazy bikers

Up there in the sky

In their black leather jackets

And steel-studded boots

And dark glasses that hide their eyes

Just like in the movies.

And what they like to do best

Is to race each other in the pouring rain.

##
I think

When they mount their bikes and

KICK them to life

Steel strikes steel

There's your lightning!

Then, when they do what bikers do

Rev up their engines, and rrrev them,

and rrrev them

There's your thunder!

##
I think that's where the thunder comes from

Not from a demon,

not from a plane,

But from a fleet of bikes that race in the rain.

I'm clever, aren't I, sister?

##
I know you are, little brother, I know you are

And maybe you're right, too...

But in all the books that I have read

That is not what they said.

Then what did they say, sister,

What did they say?

What do you think, little brother,

What do you think?

I think, I think...

Tell me, little brother, What do you think?

##
I think

That when it rains

The children

Of the old woman in the sky

Are absolutely NOT allowed

To play outside (for they may catch a cold!).

Cooped up indoors

They all get a little restless,

and VERY cranky.

##
I think the old woman opens her trunk

Pulls out a game of chaupad

And a pair of giant dice.

The children clap their hands in excitement

Roll the giant dice

And forget they were ever bored.

I think that's where the thunder comes from

From the dance of a pair of dice

As they make their way across the skies.

I'm clever, aren't I, sister?

##
Of course you are, little brother,

And maybe you're right, too...

But in all the books that I have read

That is not what they said.

Then what did they say, sister,

What did they say?

Come here, little brother,

I'll tell you what they said.

They said, they said...

Tell me sister, what did they say?

##
They said

That thunder always comes after lightning.

But you know that, don't you?

And that

It is the lightning

That makes the thunder.

##
The lightning is like ELEC-TRI-CITY

The same magic ELEC-TRI-CITY

That runs the pump

And floods the house with light

And fills the TV with Sachin and Saurav

At the flip of a switch.

But I asked about thunder, sister,

I asked about thunder.

Have patience, little brother,

Have patience now.

##
They said that lightning is very hot

Just like electricity.

And when it slices through the air

And stabs the earth

It makes the air through which it comes

Very Very Very hot.

They said

The hot air EXPANDS

And explodes BOOOOOOM!

Like a monster Diwali bomb.

##
And some little children

Bury their faces

In their mothers' sarees.

But brave little boys like you

Hear the air go BOOOOOOM!

Turn around quickly.

Can it be true, sister, can it be true?

I can't say, little brother, I can't say.

But in all the books that I have read

That is what they said.

Where does thunder come from?

Everything around us is made up of tiny particles called atoms. Each atom has a nucleus at the centre, which is filled with particles called neutrons and positively charged particles called protons. Even tinier particles (negatively charged) called electrons go around the nucleus like the planets go around the sun.

In a thundercloud, air carries bits of ice and water droplets upwards. When they rub against each other, the atoms in them become ions (that is, they become charged positively or negatively). The positive ions are lighter and move upwards, while the heavier negative ions move downwards to the bottom of the cloud.

The negative ions at the bottom of the cloud attract the positive ions on the earth. When they start flowing towards each other, electricity is created, which becomes a huge, powerful flash of lightning.

The lightning makes the air around it very, very hot almost as hot as the sun! This hot air expands very quickly, causing a big explosion. It then begins to contract equally quickly once the lightning flash has passed. This explosion of air is what causes the sound waves that we call thunder.

Try this experiment!

To understand how particles with opposite charges attract each other, let's make a magic ‘magnetic balloon'!

You need:

A balloon

A piece of wool or silk

A wall

What to do:

1. Blow up the balloon.

2. Rub it briskly with the piece of wool or silk.

3. Hold it against the wall and watch it ‘stick' there like a magnet to iron!

Why does this happen?

When you rub the balloon with the wool or silk, electrons get transferred between the two. The atoms in the balloon take in more electrons, so the balloon becomes negatively charged. When you hold it against the wall, the negative ions in the balloon get attracted to the positive ions in the wall, causing the balloon to stick to the wall!

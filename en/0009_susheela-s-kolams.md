# Susheela's Kolams

##
Susheela lives in Tamil Nadu.

She learnt to draw kolams from her mother.

##
Every Pongal, she was allowed to make one kolam all by herself.

##
Susheela loved to make kolams!

She drew them on floors and steps and walls...

##
... on trains and on the sides of tall buildings...

##
... even on kites that skipped in the sky.

Everyone admired Susheela's kolams!

##
One day, the Air Force asked her to help them make a kolam!

Susheela told the pilots how to dip, dive and turn their planes...

##
... and in minutes there was a big, beautiful and colourful kolam in the sky, that everyone in the city could see!

##
That night, Susheela stood on her terrace and looked up at the sky. She saw the stars twinkling down at her.

Where do you think Susheela will make her next kolam?

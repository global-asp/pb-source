# Best Friends Forever

##
There were two girls, they were best friends. Their names were Salima and Begum.

##
They watched each other so many times in mirror and said we both look same.

##
They played, worked, ate, slept together. One day Begum and her family shifted to Hyderabad.

##
They two cried for each other.

##
Salima also shifted to Hyderabad, the two of them's houses were near, but they don't know that. They searched for each other. They lived in the hut areas.

##
They two found each other at their houses.

##
They were so happy and hugged.

##
They lived happily ever after.

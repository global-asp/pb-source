# "My fish!" "No, my fish!"

##
Kicchu woke up early one morning.“It is time to catch some fish,” he said yawning.

##
He met Choru on the way to the pond. They were best friends who played all day long.

##
Munia saw them marching with their fishing rods.

“We are going to the pond to catch fish. Come along Munia, if you wish.”

##
Little Munia thought for sometime. “Please don't do that,” she said, “without water, the fish will die.”

##
They did not listen to what Munia had to say. They headed to the pond straight away.

##
Kicchu and Choru sat waiting by the pond. Two fish swam across, one thin and another round.

##
Then came the third fish, the biggest one they had seen. Munia said laughing, “It is bigger than Appa's feet!”

##
Kicchu and Choru held on tight to their rods.

Kicchu screamed, “MY FISH!”

Choru also screamed, “NO... MY FISH!”

##
Kicchu pulled hard...

Choru pulled harder...

##
PHAAATTT! Both the rods broke.

THUDDD! Kicchu fell to the ground.

SSSPPLAASH! Choru fell into the water.

##
What had happened?

What do you think?

The fish had tied up both the strings!

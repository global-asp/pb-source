# Browny The Horse

##
Browny was the favourite horse of a King. The majestic look of the horse, Browny, attracted everyone in the palace. He was a lucky horse for the king. But Browny was not happy. Browny thought that he had lost his freedom in the palace, though he was well taken care of.

##
One day, he managed to escape from the palace. He was galloping as fast as he could. But he could hear the king's guards chasing him. Without stopping to see, he galloped fast and reached a forest.
Only after getting into the forest, he breathed a little. Lucky for him, the guards did not enter the forest.
There he saw , many animals wandering here and there.

##
Browny joined them. He was feeling the joy of freedom. He even made friends with a deer and both Browny and the deer were chatting.

##
Suddenly there was a loud roar. Immediately, the deer shouted," Browny, run for your life. The leopard is on its way hunting for food."

##
Realising the danger he was in, he started galloping again. He galloped as fast as he could. He reached a city.

##
There was a huge crowd in a place. That was the 'Sea World', theme park. He pushed the crowd and entered the place. Seeing the horse, some boys started hitting him with stones. To escape from stones, he started running again.

##
Not knowing where to run, he ran into a large gathering. There was a big pool of water around which people were seated. That was a 'Dolphin Show'. Browny was running with such great speed that he jumped into the water in the pool.

##
Water splashed everywhere around the pool. Dolphin, ready for the show also jumped outside.
Organisers of the show tried to catch Browny. The fully wet Browny somehow managed to get outside and started galloping again.

##
He started running outside. The king's guards, searching for him, spotted him and shouted "Browny Browny". Tired Browny recognised the guards. Unable to run further, Browny decided to return to the palace.

##
After returning to the palace stable, he thought to himself," No other place on this earth is as safe and comfortable as this stable".

He also realised that escaping from the palace, is like jumping into the fire from the frying pan.

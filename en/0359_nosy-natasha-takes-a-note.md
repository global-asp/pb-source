# Nosy Natasha takes a Note

##
Every morning, Natasha's parents would awaken her brother, Karan, and her. Natasha would hurry up all her morning chores and get dressed for school.

##
Natasha loved going to school! Here she got to meet all her friends. Her friends didn't share the same enthusiasm though, because Natasha was quite meddlesome.

##
Often in her excitement to reach school, Natasha would be the first one there. This gave her a chance to snoop around. One such day, she picked up a personal diary.

##
"Nosy Natasha! Why on earth would Rohan call me that?", she cried out as she looked up from Rohan's diary, "I thought we were friends". She marched to his house.

##
"Rohan, why do you call me Nosy Natasha in your diary? That is so untrue" cried Natasha. Rohan replied, "Isn't that ironic? You just read my personal diary!"

##
"Oh I get it now", she replied, "I was being rather nosy reading your personal diary. I just did an IRONY!" She apologized for her behavior and promised never to do it again.

##
That evening, Natasha told her mom of the two lessons she had learnt. She now knew not to touch other people's things without permission and what 'irony" meant.

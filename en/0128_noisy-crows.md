# Noisy Crows

##
I live in the mango tree. I eat lots of ripe fruit in summer.

##
When my babies are in the nest, I have to be on guard.

##
Come peep into my nest. See the lovely things I have found.

##
I love to fly up in the sky, like a plane.

##
I sit on the tree and look around for some tasty bits of food.

##
I look to my right. I look to my left.

##
I love fish. When I spot it, I fly down to pick it up.

##
With my cawing I call my friends to share the feast with me.

##
Some people shout at me, “Go away, you noisy bird.”

##
Mr Fox likes my singing. He told me so himself.

##
LET US LEARN SOME NEW WORDS.

The sound that each animal or bird makes, has a special name. How many of these do you know?

A crow caws.

A cat mews.

##
A lion roars.

A dog barks.

Crows make a lot of noise. So when some people talk loudly we say, “As noisy as a crow”.

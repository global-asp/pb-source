# Little Painters

##
It was holiday time. Veena and Vinay were in the garden. There were tins of paint everywhere.

##
There was white paint and red paint and green paint and blue paint and yellow paint.

##
The painters were busy. One painter was on a ladder. Another was hanging from the roof on a swing. “Can we help?” asked Veena and Vinay.

##
The painter gave each of them a brush. “Paint the inside of the gate,” he said to Veena.

“Paint the outside of the gate,” he said to Vinay.

##
They picked up two tins of paint and set to work. Veena painted one side of the gate. Vinay painted the other side of the gate.

##
The paint fell on the ground.

The paint fell on the wall.

The paint fell on them.

##
At last they finished. They wiped off the paint that had splashed on the ground. They wiped off the paint that had splashed on the wall.

##
They wiped off the paint that had splashed on them.

##
"I love my red gate!" said Veena.

##
"I love my green gate!" said Vinay.

##
“Oh, you have made a two-coloured gate!” cried the painter.

“Let us keep it that way!” said Mother.

# Talking Tree of Alpha Town

##
Two best friends , Gini and Jojo along with their beloved doggie , Tommy, return home from school complaining about the food they got , as usual . They heard a tree calling them .

##
They ran towards the tree . Mr. Talking tree , was a 50 year old magical wise tree, living in Alpha town . He heard them talking to each other and decides to teach them how to appreciate their meals .

##
Mr. Talking Tree decided to give them different variety of food items to taste .

##
The first thing he gave them was 'Coconut water' , they found it to be very 'sweet' and 'refreshing' .

Then he gave them 'imli' which was very 'sour' .

##
Next he gave them a cup of 'coffee' . They found that to be 'bitter' but energizing .

Then he gave them a bowl of 'dal', which they enjoyed very much .

##
Gini and Jojo , realised that every food item has its own different taste and must be appreciated .

##
They go back home promising never to complain about the food they get at school or even what thier mom cooks at home .

# The brave boy!

##
Once there was a boy named Ramesh. He was very brave and wise. He worked in other town to make money and help his parents. One day he wanted to see his mother. So he took permission from his master and started his journey on foot. There was a big forest to cross to reach his village. He reached the forest within 30 minutes. He took rest for a while and again started his journey through the forest. In the mid of the jungle he saw a thief riding on a horse. He thought of a plan to get rid of him. He bravely went to the thief and asked him to accompany him to his home. The thief agreed so that he could loot all the family. When they reached home, he immediately went to his mother and told that the man who accompanied him was a thief! But he said not to worry and explained the plan. Then his mother gave the thief honey mixed with sleeping medicine. He drank it and immediately fell asleep. They took him to a dried well and dumped him there. Ramesh called all the villagers. And they found that he
was the thief they were searching for more than five years. All praised the brave boy.

# Chottu - The Little Boy

##
Chottu is 3 feet tall. His legs look like broomsticks.

##
He wears green-rimmed spectacles, cracks jokes and makes everyone laugh.

##
One day he was selected as the goalkeeper of the Manchester United junior team. He was the best in goalkeeping so he was certain to be a part of the team. He caught the ball, pounced on it and slammed it on the ground. The opposite team striker groaned, “How did I miss it?”

##
Chottu was over the moon!

##
When Chottu went home, he saw his mother making rotis in the kitchen.

##
His father was coming back home from office.

##
His grandmother was knitting on the chair.

##
. “Listen, everyone, come here! Come here!” he shouted excitedly. “What happened?” “Why are you shouting?” his mother asked angrily. "I won the football game!” he said excitedly.

“I don't believe it!” his grandmother replied delightedly.

“That's excellent!” replied his father.

“That's brilliant!” smiled his mother.

##
His father gave him a tight hug. Chottu's father promised to buy him a remote control helicopter as a present for winning the football match. Chottu felt joyful.

##
When Chottu returned to school the next day, his friends started teasing him, “Chottu – the chotta boy,” Charlie taunted. The football team he played against him were standing in the corridor and gossiping about Chottu.

##
Chottu got very annoyed. He attacked Charlie Tombstone style. He watched WWE and he was a fan of Undertaker and Kane. Charlie's neck twisted and was thrown back on the ground. Charlie's head started throbbing in pain. Seeing him on the ground, he fled.

##
Chottu was very depressed. He went home and asked his mother, “Why can't you give me Complan every day?”

“It's very expensive,” she replied.

“I want to increase my height, please give me Complan!” he pleaded. Chottu felt blue.“Okay, we will buy Complan, but on one condition.” “I will do anything!”

“I should not hear any complains about you from school.”

##
Chottu agreed. He started skipping every day to become tall. Gradually, Chottu‘s height increased. Children at school gasped. They couldn't believe how tall he had grown. So everyone finally stopped teasing Chottu.

### Habits

  A habit is a sticky thing;

Much good or evil it can bring;

It binds a victim, holds him fast,

And keeps him in a vise-like grasp.

  Bad habits grow with extra speed,

Much like a healthy,growing weed.

The roots grow deep,the stem grows stout;

How difficult to pull it out!

 Good habits are a little slow;

They need a lot of care to grow;

If tended well,they grow more fair

Than any bloom a plant can bear.

  Good habits help us all through life;

Bad habits bring us pain and strife;

Our habits weather right or wrong,

Each day will grow more firm and strong.

### To a butterfly

  I've watched you now a full half-hour;

Self-poised upon that yellow flower;

And little Butterfly!indeed

I know not if you sleep or feed.

How motionless-not frozen seas

More motionless!and then

What joy awaits you,when the breeze

Hath found you out among the trees,

And calls you forth again!

  This plot of orchard-ground is ours;

My trees are there,my Sister's flowers;

Here rest your wings when they are weary;

Here lodge as in a sanctuary!

Come often to us,fear no wrong;

We will talk of a sunshine and a song!

### The snare

  I hear a sudden cry of pain!

There is a rabbit in a snare:

Now I hear a cry again,

But I cannot tell from where.

  But I cannot tell from where.

He is calling out for aid!

Crying on the frightened air,

Making everything afraid!

  Making everything afraid!

Wrinkling up his little face!

And he cries again for aid;

-and I cannot find the place!

  And I cannot find the place!

Where his paw is in the snare!

Little one!Little one!

I'm searching everywhere!

### Silver

  Slowly,silently,now the moon

Walks the night in her silver shoon;

This way and that,she peers and sees

Silver fruit upon silver trees;

One by one the casements catch

Her beams beneath the silvery thatch;

Couched in his kennel,like a log,

With paws of silver sleeps the dog;

From their shadowy cote of white breasts peep

Of doves in a silver-feathered sleep.

### At the seaside

  Our seaside summer holidays 

are as happy as can,

we love to build sand castles,

and wade out at sea.

  And when we find an empty boat,

off we quickly go

to ask a nearby fisherman,

to take us for a row

  We ride the horse on the beach,

We drive the go kart too

It is really surprising to think

of all the things you can do.

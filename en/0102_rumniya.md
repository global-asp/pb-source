# Rumniya

##
Many years ago when Rumniya was a baby, Nana, Nani and Rumniya went to a wedding.

##
There were hundreds of people at the party, most of whom were near the food. After some time, Nani lost Rumniya.

##
When things get lost, Nani does not worry; she feels that everything will turn up, and turn out right very soon. So Nani did not feel worried.

##
On the other hand, Rumniya was only one and a half years old, so she was quite worried and not as hopeful.

##
But rather than doing any silly baby-like things like crying, Rumniya thought of doing something else.

##
In that vast crowd, it was impossible for a small girl to search for people's faces.

##
In fact, it was much easier to search for the right person by looking at people's feet, their shoes and sandals.

##
So that is what Rumniya did. She started from one end of the room.

##
She lifted up the sari of each and every woman. Then she came to a sari that was familiar, and slippers that she knew. Sure enough, when Rumniya matched the face with the sari and slippers, it was Nani!

##
And as Nani bent down to pick Rumniya up, Nani said to her friend, “See, I told you. There was nothing to worry about. Whenever you lose something, you will always find it.”

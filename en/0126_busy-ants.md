# Busy Ants

##
Hello, I am the fourth one in the line. Can you see me?

##
Left, right, left, right. We walk silently in a line.

##
I just got an idea. I am going to get a set of WHEELS to move faster!

##
We are not noisy like other animals. Ours is a language of smells.

##
One kind of smell says, “Follow me this way for a feast.”

##
Another smell says, “Danger! Do not go there.”

##
I love cakes and all kinds of sweets, just like you.

##
Want to see my muscles at work? I may look very tiny to you, but I am very strong.

##
Never mind if the door is shut. I can slip through the smallest crack.

##
Believe it or not, hundreds of us live happily in a colony.

LET US LEARN SOME NEW WORDS.

Small - Big

Slow - Fast

Short - Tall

Thin - Fat

Hard - Soft

Noisy - Quiet

Here are some words with their opposites. Can you make a sentence for each pair of opposite words?

For example, ‘An ant is small; an elephant is big'.

“As busy as an ant” is a nice way to describe someone who is very hard working.

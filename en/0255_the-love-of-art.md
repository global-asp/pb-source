# The love of art

##
Ridhima and Rohan loved painting. They painted all day. They won many art prizes in school.

##
One day, mummy told them that they were moving to a new house. The children were very happy. Mummy told them that they also had to paint the house.

##
They liked the house very much. The builders told them to paint the fence. They happily agreed.

##
After they finished, they asked the builder if they could paint the gate. The builder happily agreed.

##
After they finished, they wanted to paint the house. So they went inside.

##
They had to first clean they house. They cleaned it and then they started painting.

##
They designed the walls with fingerprints and checkers.

##
After they had finished, everyone around the neighbourhood came and praised them.

##
After the people had gone, mummy told them to make paintings. So they made them. They even sold their paintings. Mummy was very pleased with their talent.

##
Ridhima and Rohan were world famous for their paintings. They even started their own little shop. If we want to make something like them, we should love art.

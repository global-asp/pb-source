# Journey to many lands

##
Many lifetimes ago, on a rather warm, snuggly night, a dinosaur egg was on the brink of hatching. The Mama long neck lay close, watching and waiting.

A little wriggly crack appears on the egg and out pops the little one. Mama, with all the sweetness in her voice, calls her 'tiny foot!'

'It's really hot and dry here, Mama!', Tiny foot exclaimed. Every beautiful thing was destroyed because of the earthquake. Tiny foot and Mama decided to look-out for a new land. And so, they began their journey in search of marvellous new places.

One day, they arrive at a splendid, glorious place that was dressed in lush green trees, fruits, flowers. There was an explosion of colour everywhere which knocked their breaths of. Tiny foot screeched, 'This is amazing. Look at all that food, Mama. Can we please live here?'

'All right little woman, we sure will. But first, we need to keep our eyes peeled for our herd of dinosaurs.'

'What's that?'

'That is a group, Tiny foot. Dinosaurs that look alike; travel together, stay together. They form a herd. We have so many different dinosaurs, my tiny one. And so we have different herd for different dinosaurs.'

'So would we be keeping an eye out for a herd of long necks?'

'Exactly, smart you!'

And so, they carried about venturing into the deeper parts of the forest. Exploring can be such fun and a joy.

But little did they know of the velociraptors picking their trail. Velociraptors are little dinosaurs but don't be fooled by their size. They are meat-eaters. And these ones, in particular, have been hunting since morning. And their search has now come to an end. 'There goes our lunch!', one of the wicked raptors squawk.

They race ahead and leap right in front of the long necks. Tiny foot squeals and backs off. Mama is all set to defend her little one.

Mid way through the fight, one of the raptors grab hold of Mama's leg. She wails in pain.

But soon enough, they all pause for now they hear the thundering feet of a galloping Club-tail; also known as an Ankylosaurus.

She charges forward, then sharply swings her club-tail at the raptor with its teeth clamped on Mama, and gives a hard whack on his face. He flings in the air, out of sight. Watching this, the other raptor dashes off for cover.

You wouldn't want to mess up with an Ankylosaurus. It's body is covered in spikes and a heavy tail to boot! Well armoured, this one!

'Thank you for saving our lives'.

'Oh, it's nothing dear. I always come in handy in these parts', Club-tail bellows with laughter.

'Are you new here? I haven't seen you around in these parts'

'Oh yes, we are. We just got here two days ago', answers Mama. 'So then I'll show you around to folks of your kind and many more.'

'How marvellous of you! I'm already beginning to like you', smiles Mama.

And so they tagged along with Club-tail till they reached a stunning valley with flowing waters and colourful leaves covering them.

Mama and Tiny foot got along with their herd and some of the other herds of dinosaurs.

Under that starry night, when all was calm and quiet, Tiny foot with droopy yet sparkling eyes, said, 'I'm happy here, Mama. I've made some friends. But some of them look really different from me.'

'I'm glad too, Tiny foot. I've met some lovely dinosaurs as well. Some of them do appear different. But I like that. It makes them more interesting and exciting', Mama said with a gleam in her eyes.

They've finally found their happy place.

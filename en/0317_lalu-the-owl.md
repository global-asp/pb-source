# Lalu the owl

##
Lalu the owl was a friendly fellow. All the birds in the jungle were his friends.

##
But Lalu's best friend in the jungle was Sweety, the peacock.

##
One day Lalu organised a party and called all his friends.

##
In the party, all the birds danced and gifted Lalu with a crown of feathers.

##
Lalu slept happily that night.

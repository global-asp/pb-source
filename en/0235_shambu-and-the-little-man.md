# Shambu and the little man

##
Shambu the junior explorer was walking in a forest.

He was going to a neighbouring village to meet his friend.

##
He suddenly hears a tiny cry of pain.

Shambu was confused. He thought" Oh no!I think someone small is hurt".

He takes out his magnifying glass to find out.

##
Shambu was correct. There sitting under a mushroom was a tiny man.

The tiny man looked as if he was lost.

##
Shambu asked the man what was the matter.

The little man said that he had lost his way and it had rained heavily.

Shambu said he would give the man shelter until the rain dried out.

##
Shambu played and played with the man all day unti it was dark.

Then the man and Shambu said their goodbyes and they were on their way.

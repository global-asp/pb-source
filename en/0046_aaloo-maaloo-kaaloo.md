# Aaloo-Maaloo-Kaaloo

##
For the very first time, Maaloo is collecting vegetables from the garden. He has collected red tomatoes, fresh brinjals and green lady's fingers.

##
Dadi says, “Well done, Maaloo! Go and get some potatoes too.”

##
Maaloo looked at all the trees, creepers and plants. Not a single potato could he see.

##
“Dadi, the potatoes aren't ready yet,” said Maaloo, putting the empty basket down.

“No Maaloo, there are plenty of potatoes. Look carefully,” said Dadi.

##
Maaloo went into the garden once more. Kaaloo followed him.

Maaloo was looking for potatoes when he heard, “Woof! Woof!”

##
“Kaaloo! Stop, Kaaloo!” yelled Maaloo, running behind him. “Don't spoil the garden.” Maaloo saw that Kaaloo was digging away and what do you think was coming out of the mud?

Big fat potatoes!

##
“Well done, Kaaloo. You found the potatoes!” laughed Maaloo, filling his basket with potatoes.

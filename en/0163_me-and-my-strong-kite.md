# Me and my Strong Kite

##
I have a kite which is strong and has enough might,

When I sail it up in the air it starts to fight with the other kites.

My kite is big, cartoony and wide,

When it wanders a bit, my father sets it right!

When it rains at night,

I think about if I could fly my kite!

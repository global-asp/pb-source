# Bunty and Bubbly

##
Bunty loves to play with butterflies...

##
...and with birds.

##
She loves to play with paper boats.

##
She also likes to make sand castles.

##
When Bunty goes back home,

her mother asks her to clean up.

But she refuses.

##
"I hate soaps!" she screams.

##
One night, she has a dream.

The germs are all around her castle, and are attacking her.

##
Bunty is chased by the germs.

She runs for her life and screams, “Help... Help!”

##
Suddenly, Soap King Bubbly appears.

“Bunty, don't be afraid,” he says. “Go attack the germs!”

the Soap King orders his army of bubbles.

##
The army of bubbles chases the germs away.

##
These days, Bunty likes to use soap,

and she brushes and scrubs herself clean.

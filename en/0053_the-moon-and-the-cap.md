# The Moon and The Cap

##
All of us went to the Dasara fair.

##
Papa bought Chintu fancy glasses. Mother bought me a bright blue cap. The baby got sugar candy.

##
On the way home, a very strong wind came.

It blew my cap away.

##
My cap got stuck on a branch of the old Pipal tree.

##
I cried a lot. And I did not eat my dinner.

##
Later that night, the moon came up.

It looked at my cap on the old Pipal tree.

##
It tried on my cap. The moon smiled happily. I had to smile too.

##
After school the next day, my mother gave me a shiny new red cap. “The moon sent it,” she said.

##
That night, both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled.

We were happy.

##
Do you think the sun needs a hat?

##
Guess which cap I am wearing today!

# What Does Anu See?

##
Anu loves to look at things,

big things and small.

Houses on hills,

ants on a wall.

##
Things in the kitchen,

things on the shelf.

Things in the garden,

things on herself.

##
Anu sees patterns

and shapes everywhere,

nothing at all can escape her stare!

##
Spots on a ladybird,

circles in trees,

shapes made by people,

shapes made by bees.

##
Lines on a leaf, just

like lines on her hand.

The marks of her feet

in wet seaside sand.

##
Waves in the water,

waves in her hair.

Mushrooms on tree

trunks, birds in the air.

##
Words in a book that

can take her to places,

full of new colours,

new stories, new faces.

##
Things of the colour that

she loves best - RED!

The three wiggly hairs on

her brother Boo's head.

##
Sprinkles on the cake

Daddy baked today,

like the stars that twinkle

at her from far away.

##
Rabbits in clouds

floating up in the sky.

Elephants in shadows -

come, give it a try!

##
Anu is happy with the

things that she sees.

Do you also see what

little Anu sees?

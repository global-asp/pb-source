# Wonders of Martina's Adventure

##
It was a very surprisingly cool and peaceful day. The day appeared to be even more charming as there was a beautiful view of the calm, blue sea. The sea was glistening in the sunshine. On the shore of the beach lived an explorer, who was very adventurous and daring. Her name was Martina. She had traveled to many islands and had studied the different species of flora and fauna there. She had been taking a walk on the shore when she found a bottle with a paper inside it. The paper was a map of an island within the pacific ocean with a variety of beautiful species that interested Martina a lot. She immediately planned to travel to that island along with some of her fellow adventurers - Julie and Sam.

It was very comfortable for Martina to travel any where as her friend Sam had an enormous and beautiful ship that sailed very peacefully without leading them to any obstacles. They had very soon boarded the magnificent ship and had packed all their required books, cameras and set off into the sea. Adventures started for Martina very soon because she saw many dolphins swimming beside the ship. At midday, Martina and Julie decided to go diving to see the different species of fish and plants.

And alas! they were surrounded by spectacular coral reefs and found clown fish in between some corals. They saw sea anemone, puffer fish and a rookery of seals. Martina was never so happy to see the sea in its best natural, lively and colorful form.

They had spent the night in the ship, still travelling across the sea.

The next day she was awoken by a flock of very loud seagulls, diving into the sea for their yummy feast. Sam and his ship had co- operated very well enabling them to reach their destination quite in time for their adventure! Very soon Julie saw a mass of land above the waters of the pacific ocean and declared that this must be the island they all had started this journey for. Very soon they had dropped the anchor of the ship and began walking deep into the island. This island was very mysterious. Near the shore, the land was marshy with trees that had aerial roots and where there was water flooded in. As they went deeper into the island they saw many species of birds of paradise hanging upside down on the branches of evergreen trees.

They also saw a wide variety of insectivorous and orchid plants. It was truly a wonderful experience for Martina and her friends. As they went deeper with the help of a compass, they found many rock caves and shelters which had pictures depicting the lives of the early human beings on this planet. The paintings were made using the coloring material available on the island. As they went into the caves they had seen the rocky wall and tried to see if they could find any more paintings when suddenly Julie tripped over something and fell onto the ground. As soon as she got up, she found many tools and weapons made of stone which belonged to people of the past. After visiting the caves, they started back in their ship to Martina's house. Martina had a really exciting trip as she could see so many different things in her journey.

The End!!!!

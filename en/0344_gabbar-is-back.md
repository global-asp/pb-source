# Gabbar Is Back

##
Once upon a time there was a crocodile named Gabbar. Gabbar was scared of swimming. So he could not catch the fishes in the water. Gabbar used to hide behind the tall grass and look longingly at the fishes with his mouth watering to eat them. He was not a little crocodile any more, but still his Aai used to get fish from the lake and feed him everyday but only when nobody else was looking.

##
One day Gabbar was very hungry and Gabbar started crying. His mother could not see him cry, so she quickly brought a fish for him. Seeing this Beduk and Baabo the frogs started laughing "drav drav", Sapu the snake started laughing "Hisssssss Hissssss", Titli and Fullpakhru the butterflies started laughing loudly. "Gabbar is a baby, Gabbar is a baby" they all made fun of him.

##
Gabbar felt ashamed and he started crying. Gabbar was a very sad crocodile that day. All the other animals saw sad Gabbar and felt sorry for him. Seeing Gabbar sad his best friend Gogalguy the snail felt very bad and he decided to help Gabbar. Gogalguy got an idea. He shared his plans with the other animals. Titli the butterfly came and told Gabbar that Gogalguy is drowning.

##
Hearing about his friend Gogalguy drowning Gabbar jumped in the water and started swimming. He forgot all about his fear of swimming in the water. He only wanted to save his friend Gogalguy. He went searching for his friend, swimming from one end of the lake to the other end but he could not find Gogalguy anwhere. Gabbar started crying. Titli flew and kissed Gabbar on his forehead and told him " Gabbar, Gogalguy is safe and he is on land. All this was a part of plan. Gabbar see you are swimming now, You are a Hero". All the animals and Gabbars Aai were very happy seeing Gabbar swim. Ever since Gabbar is a happy crocodile.

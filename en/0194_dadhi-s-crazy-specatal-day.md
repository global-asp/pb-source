# Dadhi's crazy specatal day

##
I like to hide dadhi's spectacles.

##
When she finds it, I end up get scoldings.

##
Sometimes she is angry with me.

##
Sometimes she is not.

##
When dadhi loses her spectacles, I help her find it.

##
And I try to knit her a sweater.

##
To end her day I sing her a song.

##
To end her day I sing her a song.

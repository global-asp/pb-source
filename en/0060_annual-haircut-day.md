# Annual Haircut Day

##
It was the Annual Haircut Day for Sringeri Srinivas.

##
Sringeri Srinivas left home as usual to go to the local barber.

##
But the barber said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”

##
Feeling sad, Sringeri Srinivas went back home to ask his wife for help.

##
But his wife said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”

##
Feeling a little angry, Sringeri Srinivas went to his friend, the tailor.

##
But the tailor said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”

##
Now a little worried, Sringeri Srinivas went to one more friend, the carpenter.

##
But the carpenter said, “Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!”

##
Poor Sringeri Srinivas. It seemed no one would cut his hair on this Annual Haircut Day.

##
In tears, he walked off by himself past the village forest.

##
He sat near a cave and cried loudly.

##
“The day is nearly over. How can I keep my promise to cut my hair? Oh God, help me!”

##
The tiger sleeping peacefully inside the cave was very disturbed by all the noise.

##
He came out, roaring, waving his giant paws at Sringeri Srinivas.

##
Poor Sringeri Srinivas was so scared, so scared, so scared that ...

##
... all the hair fell off his head!

##
Sringeri Srinivas ran all the way back to the village.

The tiger went back to sleep.

##
Now, Sringeri Srinivas will not need a haircut for a very long time.

Wondering what to do with wordless stories?

Wordless stories are wonderful because they contain infinite possibilities. Here are a few ideas for engaging with children using visual stories:

- Explore the story in a leisurely manner. Draw attention to the details - the expressions of the characters, setting, colours, etc. The idea is for each child to build her own story. If the story is being shown to a group of children, you could ask each of them to contribute a sentence or two for each illustration. Take joy in exploring each illustration and build the story as you go along.

- Use themes explored in the story to start a discussion. For instance, in this story, you could ask children about what they do for their birthday, or even how they help out at home.

- Encourage children to create 2-3 different stories using the same set of visuals. This will help push their imagination.

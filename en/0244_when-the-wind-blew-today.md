# When the Wind Blew Today...

##
... I saw a kite flying a frog (or maybe it was the frog that flew the kite)...

##
...and a feather flying an ant (or maybe the ant was flying the feather)...

##
...and a water droplet flying a gnat (or maybe the gnat flew the droplet)...

##
...and a balloon that flew a rat (or maybe it was the rat that flew the balloon).

##
What did you see when the wind blew today?

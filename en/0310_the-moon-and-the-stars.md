# The Moon and the Stars

##
The moon and the stars were very good friends. After Mr. Sun would go home in the evening, they would all come out to play in the night's sky and light up the whole world with their sparkle!

##
The stars would slide on the moon, dance around him and play hide and seek. This would go late into the wee hours after midnight.

It was indeed a beautiful and celestial sight - The midnight sky, the silver moon with it's cool golden beam and the sparkling stars. The children down below, enjoyed viewing the magical playground above.

##
One night Mr. Moon slept in as he was feeling tired and was not in the mood to play. But the stars came out on time and began to call out to Mr. Moon.

"Mr. Moon, Mr. Moon come out now. Let's play catch and cook" But there was no response.

After having waited for a while, the stars began to play among-st themselves. Seeing this, Mr. Moon went red with anger. He felt neglected and like a little child he came out screaming and shouting at the stars. He said some very harsh and mean things to them. The stars felt hurt and left the night's sky never wanting to return.

##
For many days the stars didn't come out. The sky looked empty and vacant. Mr. Moon was very sad. He missed the stars. The children below too were sad to see the lonely moon.

One evening, Mr. Sun before leaving for his home, called out to Mr. Moon and said " My dear Mr. Moon, you miss your star friends so much. You know you have done a wrong thing by saying such harsh things to them. Now make up for your mistake by apologizing and calling out to them".

Mr. Moon saw sense and began to call out to the stars. He apologized for his behavior and invited them warmly to play with him. The stars listened to Mr. Moon and accepted his apology and thanked him for his invitation.

##
The stars came gushing out and filled the sky with glitter and star dust once again! The moon was only too happy to see his friends after a long lonely gap.

The sky looked beautiful once again with the moon, the stars, and the all the glitter.

The children too were happy to see the sparkling sky and the bright moon amongst the diamond like stars.

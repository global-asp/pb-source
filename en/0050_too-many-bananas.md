# Too Many Bananas

##
Sringeri Srinivas was having a very bad day.

Nobody wanted the sweet, ripe bananas he was growing on his farm.

##
Not his family.

Not his neighbour.

Not his friends.

##
Not the traders who could sell the bananas in far away markets. And not even his cows!

##
“No, thank you,” they all said. “The bananas are very sweet but we have had too many. We cannot eat any more!”

##
Poor Sringeri Srinivas!

What was he to do now with his rich harvest of bananas?

##
He decided to seek help from the Farmer's Centre in Doddooru, a big town near his village.

##
Off he went carrying the best crop of bananas.

Surely someone there would have a good idea for him.

##
A few days later, Sringeri Srinivas returned home looking very happy. He went back to growing bananas on his farm.

##
But he did not offer the fruits to anyone anymore.

##
Not to his family.

Not to his neighbour.

Not to his friends.

##
Not to the traders who could sell the bananas in far away markets. And not even to his cows!

##
Everyone became very curious.

Where were all the bananas going?

##
One day, neighbour Shivanna arranged a very big pooja.

##
The priest asked him to get 108 ripe bananas as an offering to the gods.

##
Shivanna ran to Sringeri Srinivas. “I'm sorry for saying no to you before, but now I need 108 ripe bananas.

Can you help me, please?”

##
Sringeri Srinivas tapped his chin. “Well, my crop has just been cut but let me see what I can do. You may start your pooja. I will surely come.”

##
The pooja started.

The whole village came to watch.

The priest began chanting.

##
Soon it became time to offer bananas to the gods.

##
Just then, in came Sringeri Srinivas carrying a big bag.

##
From the bag, he carefully took out 27 packets and laid them out before the holy fire. Each packet was carefully wrapped in banana leaf.

##
On each one was written - “High Quality Banana Halwa, S. S. Farms.” Sringeri Srinivas offered one to the priest.

##
“Each one has the pulp of 4 bananas. There are 27 packets. So here are your 108 ripe bananas!”

##
The priest was so surprised that he forgot to chant. In the silence, one child began to laugh.

##
Soon the whole village was laughing and clapping.

##
Now we know what Sringeri Srinivas does with all the bananas that he grows!

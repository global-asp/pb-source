# Mittai Lals' Sweet Dream

##
Mittai Lal was very fond of sweets. He was fat and round like a laddu.

He would stop by the halwayi every day, to eat ladoos, Jalebis and Jamuns.

##
One night while resting after dinner, he craved for Gulab jamuns.

He soon ran to the halwayi, hoping to eat yummy Jamuns.

##
But alas! The shop was closed.

So Mittai Lal returned home sad, his tummy growling.

##
He went to bed and soon fell asleep.

He was dreaming of sweets even in his sleep.

##
He dreamt that he was standing atop a mountain of laddus, surrounded by jalebis.

A little far away, he could see a pool full of Jamuns.

##
The sight of syrupy jamuns mesmerized him.

So, he greedily jumped from the mountain of laddus to the pool of Jamuns.

##
Thud!! He fell off from his cot.

“Ouch! “ He screamed in pain from the fall.

Mittai Lal's sweet dream was broken, so was his arm!

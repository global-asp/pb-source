# We Are All Animals

##
ACT-1

##
Look at me, animals! I am a human being! I know everything!

##
Look, these are my eyes. I can see everything with them.

##
So what? We have eyes too. And we can see in the dark!

##
Fine, but look at my nose. I breathe through my nose.

##
So what? We also have noses and ours are prettier than yours!

##
And yes, my teeth. I use my teeth to chew and bite.

##
Teeth? Ha! Ha! Have you seen our teeth?

You can chew. But WE CAN BITE! Hiee.. Hiee...Hiee...

##
Yes, but listen! I can hear a lot with my ears!

##
Little one! We can hear sounds which you cannot imagine at all!

##
And I can walk, run and even dance with my feet.

##
Oh! We have four feet! We can jump, we can dance

and we can parade too!

##
I can plait my hair.

##
Uh! Our hair is pretty too.

We could plait it if we wanted to. Maybe!

##
Look! I can work with my hands!

##
Hands! Keep your hands to yourself!

##
ACT-2

##
Aha! I told you! I am the best! I know it all!

##
Really?

Have you seen our sharp claws?

##
Yes! But your nails will pick up dirt!

##
Now see, these are our lovely tails.

##
Tails! We gave them up long ago!

How else could we wear our shorts?

##
And we can roar!

##
Roar? Have you heard my mother?

##
So then! You are only animals - I know that!

##
Humans are animals too. We know that!

##
You may be right. Look at my brother!

Mother says he is wild. He is definitely an animal.

##
Yes! And so are you! Believe us! We are all animals.

We all belong here. Just like you.

# Life full of dreams

##
Mansha is the only daughter of her parents. Since they both used to work to earn a living, Mansha was brought up by her granny.

##
Granny used to narrate lovely stories to Mansha at night as well as during the day. Due to this, Mansha had developed the habit of dreaming of living a life inspired by nature.

##
One day granny and Mansha were walking in the garden. As Mansha came across beautiful flowers blooming gracefully, she told her granny, " I dream to become like these flowers which are a symbol of love, peace and beauty. I shall symbolize harmony!"

##
Upon reaching home, as she sat by the window she saw the birds flying high up in the sky. She called out to her granny and said, "Granny! I dream to become a bird so that I can fly high up in the sky and touch it!"

##
At night when she was listening to her granny's bed-time story about stars, she jumped up with joy and said, "Granny! I dream to become a star so that I can twinkle and shine bright and spread light everywhere!"

##
Her granny hugged her and said, "You should dream big but for that you got to have a lot of patience and courage to make to dream come true." Mansha replied, "Yes granny! With your guidance and support I shall surely fulfill my dreams." Saying so she hugged her granny and got lost in her world of dreams.

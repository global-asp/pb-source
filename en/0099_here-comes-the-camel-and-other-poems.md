# Here Comes the Camel and Other Poems

##
Butterfly

I met a butterfly,

yellow, black and brown.

Hovering over flowers,

flying up and down.

She sits so near

I touch her with no fear.

At once she flies away,

she sits but doesn't stay.

##
Thump Thump

Thump Thump goes the elephant!

Thump Thump the elephant comes!

He lifts his trunk, he lowers it.

Wading into the water,

his trunk becomes a shower.

##
Bump Bump goes the elephant!

Bump Bump the elephant comes!

Bananas for his big fat tum,

he eats ten and counts one!

Burp Burp goes the elephant!

Burp Burp the elephant comes!

##
Off to School

Leaves are green

and flowers red.

Ready for school

as you leave the bed.

Left your pencil,

dropped your book!

Pick them up

and off to school!

##
Flying High

Lovely little butterfly,

yellow and blue butterfly.

She looks like a petal on a flower,

crossing flowerbeds afar.

A wave of colour,

with her wings aflutter,

she looks so bright.

Her quiet flight,

in the morning light.

##
Here Comes the Camel

Here comes the camel

rocking gently down the road!

Such a tall animal!

Here comes the camel!

With a neck so tall,

and a back so high,

the camel gently goes by.

##
His feet like the sand,

carrying loads across the land,

walking quietly on the sand.

When he tires, he will sit.

On his right or his left?

That is his own SECRET!

##
Peacock

Look how the peacock dances,

on dainty steps he advances.

All his feathers in an arc,

glowing hues light and dark.

When the sky turns cloudy grey,

the peacock begins to sway.

Moving gently on his feet,

dancing to the rainy beat!

##
Food So Precious!

How about some idli-dosa,

or a nice hot samosa?

Let us eat some sweet mithai,

yummy rabri and malai!

Would you like some poori bhaji, or fried brinjal bhaaja?

##
Spongy fresh dhokla is nice,

to gobble up in a trice.

But do not hurry when you eat, careful not to spill any treat.

Because FOOD is so precious,

and also so DELICIOUS!

##
Drip Drop

Drip Drop raindrops!

Can I touch them as they Plop?

Eyes shut and face upturned,

for silver beads on curling lashes.

Eyes open to see what splashes!

Leaves and branches dripping wet.

Birds shedding little droplets!

Silver sheets on roofs and walls,

I see the rain as it falls!

##
The Race

A tumbling red tomato,

racing green peas!

Stumbling came the cauliflower,

not far behind is coriander!

Who will reach the finish line

in this race against time?

##
Swinging High

To and fro swings the doll,

pulled by the bird so small.

Uncle Monkey hides a smile,

in his hat of the latest style.

Aunty Kitten is also here

using her fat glasses to peer.

She also wants to have a go

to touch the sky, to and fro!

##
Umbrella

Who went to the market with Papa?

His dear old umbrella!

He is safe from the beating sun with his dear old umbrella!

His bag in his right hand,

guess what the left demands?

##
When the rain comes pouring down,

Umbrella-time all around!

It gets wet but keeps Papa dry.

Like a roof on his head that is not very high!

##
Paper Boat

Let us make a paper boat,

in the water it will float!

Away floats the paper boat

running to a river unknown.

Dancing on the swirling waves, a little speck as it sails away!

##
My Pencil

My pencil is so special,

it jots down letters neat.

In maths, it's hard to beat!

Leaves and flowers, plants and pots, lions and birds, it draws in a shot!

Drawing lines for a house so tall, my special pencil does it all!

##
Chugetty Chug

There goes the train,

Chugetty Chug!

On the tracks,

Chugetty Chug!

The longest whistle in the land, Chugetty Clack!

Not the slow passenger train,

the fastest sleekest streaking Mail!

Chugetty Clack

Goes the train!

##
My Ball

Bounce Bounce

goes my ball!

Run Run

runs my ball!

I like to run

for my ball!

Quickly hides

my naughty ball!

Bounce Bounce

comes my ball!

I'm happy

when I find my ball!

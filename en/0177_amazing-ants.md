# Amazing Ants

##
This is Ramu. He was eating some sweets and few pieces fell down. After sometime he saw a big black line. He goes closer to see what it was and finds they were ants coming in a line to eat the sweet.

##
Each ant carries a piece of sweet on its back. They all stuck together to carry the sweet.

##
Ramu once again saw the ants going back home in a line. The ants had a big feast that night.

##
See how the ants shared their food with each other.

Do you also share your food with others?

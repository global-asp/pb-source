# Akash's sweet lesson to brush

##
Akash is a little boy who loves sweets. He loves yummy laddoos, cupcakes, pudding and cakes.

##
He talks about it to his friends and sneaks yummy cupcakes into his bed.

##
He has never stopped dreaming about it. All he can think of is something sweet for his sweet tooth.

##
He sneaks every night to have some sugar.

##
He imagines a cake awaiting for him in his dream. However he refuses to brush his teeth at night even though mommy and daddy has warned him about tooth monsters.

##
One day he went to bed, just as usual dreaming about his cake he saw a huge monster went whoosh into his mouth and scared him. The monster said "I will eat all your teeth away if you don't brush your teeth".

##
Akash woke up crying and running frantically to his parents. He said "mom and dad, I will not go to bed without brushing my teeth from now on, I do not want tooth monster."

##
Mom and dad were surprised and definitely excited that Akash wanted to brush his teeth.

##
Not only that day Akash started brushing every morning and evening so he can enjoy all his sweets without worrying about germs.

Good bye germs.

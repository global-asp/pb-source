# My Home

##
This is my home.

##
I live here with my whole family.

##
We take off our shoes and chappals here.

##
This is where we wash our face and hands.

##
I hang my clothes on the hook.

##
My grandfather keeps his stick in the corner.

##
We also keep our mats there.

##
My father keeps his motorcycle outside.

##
But his helmet is on the cupboard.

##
My mother and grandmother keep their saris in the trunk.

##
Tasty food is cooked in the kitchen.

##
When it is cold, we bring out quilts.

##
When it is hot, we use a fan.

##
When we have important guests, we bring out the chairs.

##
You must come and visit my home. Come soon.

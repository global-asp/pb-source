# Guess this place? Ghost Town!

##
At the tip of South India, there lies a beautiful beach

No one lives there and it's quite hard to reach!

5000 years ago, here Lord Rama had crossed..

Looking for his wife Sita, who was lost

Ravana had taken her to Lanka, across the mighty ocean

How could Rama reach there, for he had no magic potion?

##
Ravana had crossed it in his flying machine, for he was rich!

But Lord Rama was poor, so he had to build a bridge.

Lord Rama and his vaanar sena began building a bridge of floating stones

Back in Lanka, when Vibheeshana heard this, he got afraid and moaned!

##
But arrogant Ravana refused to listen to his brother

So Vibheeshana left Lanka to join the camp - other!

Finally, the bridge was ready, but Lord Rama's army was in fear

To calm them, and for good luck, to Lord Shiva did Rama send a prayer..

##
All this happened at Dhanushkodi, a place that is a ghost town

People used to live there, until the place was destroyed by a cyclone

Even now, the temple here has the miraculous floating stones

You can reach here by jeep

which rides in the water deep,

but the ride may make your bones groan!

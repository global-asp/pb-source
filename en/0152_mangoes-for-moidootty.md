# Mangoes For Moidootty

##
It was the middle of the summer holidays.

##
"Look, Malu!" yelled Moidootty.

##
"Giant, juicy mangoes! How I wish I could have a few!" sighed Moidootty.

##
"Hmm..." said Malu. "What we need is a demon. He can shake the tree and make it rain mangoes!

##
So they ran back home to see what their grandmother's magical recipe book had to say about calling demons.

"Look! Here's just the spell we need," cried Malu.

##
"Boil a nail and some keys,

Add some money, if you please..

##
"Now top it with some rice and dice.

Your demon will be here in a trice!"

##
Suddenly, a loud rumble shook the house. Malu and Moidootty ran outside. The sky had turned green and the sun had gone white!

##
Then a bolt of silver lightning shot through the sky. And a loud, scary voice echoed from the clouds.

##
"Who dares to wake up Aamasura?!" roared the demon. "A-Ha! I smell mangoes! I have not had mangoes in centuries! Now I wont stop until I've eaten every single one!"

##
Aamasura opened his mouth wide and began to swallow everything around him. He even gobbled up the clouds in the sky!

##
"OH NO!" cried the children. "Why did we meddle with magic? Now that Aamasura has eaten all the clouds, he will gobble up every single mango on the tree. And then...."

##
"Look!" shouted Malu. "There goes Ummumma! She can help us out!" The children ran to their grandmother and told her everything.

Ummumma laughed. "Aamasura may look big and scary. But all demons are afraid of water! They simply cant bear to be clean!

##
Ummumma flicked her blue sari across the sky...

##
.... and rain clouds began to appear.

##
And then it began to rain!

##
"AAAARRRGGHH!! I'm wet! I'm cold! I'm clean! How horrible!!"

##
BAM! Aamasura vanished in a flash of white light.

##
And Moidootty ran to catch the mangoes as they fell from the tree.

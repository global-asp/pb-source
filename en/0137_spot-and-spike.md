# Spot and Spike

##
"You are such a boring, ordinary circle," said Spike to Spot, as he bit into the cake. "Look at me. I'm strong, sharp and poky. I can make you cry!"

##
"Eeeeeee! Spikes!" shrieked Spot.

"Yes, aren't I scary?" said Spike.

"Not you! Look there. S... S... Spikier... stronger... sharper... pokier... teeth... shark swimming this way!"

##
"Shark?" yelped Spike, looking out into the sea.

Spot quickly pulled out her red gel tube. "Hee hee. Boring spots coming up," sniggered Spot.

##
"Huh? Where's the shark?" said Spike.

##
Spike picked up his cake to take another bite. "Eeeeeee! Spots!" he shrieked.

"Yes, aren't they boring? Probably just harmless chicken pox spots," said Spot.

##
"Boring! Harmless! What's harmless about spots? Blech!" screamed Spike. "Spots are scary!"

Latika , Vidvath and Shubhi were very excited to know that they would go to Gudi Gudi on a vacation.

Shubhi and Latika had brought some fruits , but feared that the ants will eat them. Vidvath brought his paratha along as well.

Everyone happily went to the station along with Mummy and Papa. The porter took the luggage along

Vidvath , Latika and Shubhi sat on their seats. They had the vegetables and fruits as well which they had brought. Everybody had a great lunch.

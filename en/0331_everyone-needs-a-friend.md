# Everyone needs a friend

It was a beautiful day, Gagan the Giraffe was strolling across the forest, when he passed a herd of Zebras. Gagan looked at their stripes and then at the patchwork of color on his body. He thought to himself, that he was a handsome giraffe, much better looking than the zebras.

The bushes were full of lush green leaves and bees were going purposefully about their tasks. Gagan stopped near a delicious looking plant and started to taste its leaves. As he was munching away he sensed something behind him. "Who's there?" he asked, turning toward the bushes. Aakar, are you and the other ants trying to frighten me?" There was no answer. Thinking it must have been his imagination, Gagan continued eating the leaves.

Laabh, a lion, was watching the giraffe from behind the bushes. He was feeling hungry and his mouth drooled over thoughts of eating the giraffe. "He is rather big," Laabh whispered. "I don't think I can bring him down all by myself." Laabh ran off to the pride and asked his friend Lali to help him get the Giraffe and they can share the kill.

Lali followed Laabh through the grass. They stopped and peeked out from behind the bushes. "He is huge. I don't think just two of us can bring that giraffe down. Why don't you go and get someone else. I'll stay here and keep an eye on him," Lali said. Laabh ran back to the pride.

"Who's there? I know someone is in those bushes. Are you sure it's not you, Aakar?" the giraffe gulped. He was starting to get nervous.

Lali had always liked giraffes. Giraffes had captured her heart with their grace, and beauty.

She stepped out from behind the bushes. "Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you," she said. Gagan was terrified. "You're a lion. Lions eat giraffes. Why shouldn't I be afraid?"

"Laabh's gone back to the pride to get another lion. They want you for lunch," Lali said. "What? They want to eat me? Do you want to eat me too?" Gagan asked.

"No. I'm full from breakfast. We've got to get you out of here before they come back. Follow me, I'll take you to a safe place" Lali said. Gagan was surprised when she ran into a cave. "We're going into a cave?" he asked." It's the only safe place for you right now. The ceiling is tall enough for you to stand comfortably. Stay here. I'm going back to the pride to tell them you're gone," Lali said and ran off, leaving the frightened giraffe alone. An hour later Lali came back. "You are safe now. They weren't happy that you had disappeared but cheered up when a deer walked by." Gagan left the cave and walked beside his new friend. "Thank you, Lali. You saved my life."" Everyone needs a friend," she said and darted across the savanna to where the other lions were. The greatest gift of life is friendship, and I have received it, thought Gagan to himself.

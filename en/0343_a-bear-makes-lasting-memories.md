# A bear makes lasting memories

##
tra-la-la-la...rum-pa-pum-pa-pum... What a lovely day to make some memories! Let me set up my camera and start clicking away.

##
Click Click. Waah! The warm glow of the sun now caught in my camera so beautifully.

##
I have no words to describe the breathtaking scenery in front of me. Maybe only the images in my camera can do justice to it. Click Click.

##
Oh! But wait! Even though it is all so stunning, something is amiss. I am missing something. What is it that does not feel right?

##
Ah! Yes! I got it. My eyes are the best camera and my brain is the best memory. Let me stand here and soak it all in. No camera. No clicks. Just me and Mother Nature in all it's glory. I will cherish this forever in my heart. Now it clicks perfectly!

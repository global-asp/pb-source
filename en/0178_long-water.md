# Long Water

##
I am a body of water. I am long. I go from here to there.

There is a riddle about me.

Read what I can do.

Can you guess who I am?

##
I am big. I am bigger than a stream. I have lot of water. My water is used for drinking.

They say I always run. I never walk.

My water moves from here to there. They say I flow.

##
I have a mouth. But I never eat. I can't even talk. You hear the sound when I flow.

I move soil and small rocks. I help move logs of wood.

I do so much work but I don't have hands.

##
I have a bed. But I don't sleep. I am always awake.

I am always moving.

I make soil. I make valleys.

My water is sweet.

##
Let me tell you again. I have no legs but I can run.

I can't eat or talk but I have a mouth.

I have a long bed but I never sleep.

I have a bank but there is no money in it. Did you guess who am I?

##
A river! I am a river.

Do you know some names I have?

# Subami's Family

##
I am Subaami. This is my mother- Swetha.

My father's name is Sujan. My brother's name is Shreyas.

All our names begin with S!

Shreyas and I, made the picture on the wall.

##
Today Amma has worn a saree that is just the colour of the sun in the picture.

It looks so pretty with orange and red and yellow.

##
Amma goes to office. She reads a lot. She makes very nice food.

Hmmmmm...smells so good!

I think she is making sweet corn curry.

##
We have a pet cat.

Her name also begins with S- Sweety.

##
My grandma lives with us.

She tells me stories, I read my story books to her.

And her name? Sundaravalli.

##
And S...yes, we are one sweet happy family!

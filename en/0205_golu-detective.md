# Golu Detective

##
Little Golu was roaming in a jungle with a magic torch in his hand. Golu always wanted to become a detective.

##
Suddenly he saw red colored umbrellas in the jungle. They were very big in size.

##
Golu went near the red umbrellas. And look what he found with his magic torch?

A cute little girl.

##
She was lost in the jungle while playing. So she was very sad.

##
Golu promised her to take her back home. And they became good friends

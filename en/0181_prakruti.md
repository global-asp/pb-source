# Prakruti

##
Prakruti loved reading stories with Ajji, while Golu, their cat, slept at their feet. "Ajji, tell me a story about me!" she squealed.

##
So Ajji began, "Prakruti or Prakriti means Nature".

"Nature? What does that mean?", asked Prakruti.

"Look outside", said Ajji.

##
Prakruti is the leaves on the ground,

the birds on the trees.

##
Prakruti is the rolling hills

and the breeze..

##
Prakruti is the rain, the thunder

and cold..

##
Prakruti is the summer, yellow

and gold..

##
Prakruti is the mango tree in our

courtyard..

##
Prakruti is the flower in our

frontyard..

##
Prakruti is the snow on the

mountain tops ..

##
Prakruti is the desert where

sand is lots..

##
Prakruti is a sapling basking in the

sunlight..

##
Prakruti is the silver lining in the

moonlight..

##
Prakruti is the nature within us

helpful, loving and full of joy..

##
"And this is the story about Prakruti, I hope you enjoy",

ended Ajji.

"Oh! I love this story Ajji. I love this story about me very much!"

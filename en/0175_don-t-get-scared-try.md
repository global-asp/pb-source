# Don't get scared! Try!

##
In the village of Bagnebaghursiddim, there lives a girl named Tiya. She has a pet named Tofu. You will be thinking he is a dog or a cat, but no it is an elephant. She really loves it and her happiness is in Tofu's happiness. Tofu was very good at running and was faster than everyone in Bagnebaghursiddim. Faster than Mr. Kamparrot, Mr. Deergo and even faster than Mr. Sherkhan.

##
One day , there was a running competition held in Badarsikhwaserdem. Tofu asked Tiya if he can participate in the competition and as expected she allowed. They both set of early in the morning.

##
As they reached Badarsikhwaserdem , Tofu started practising hard. Tiya encouraged him and told him to take rest. Tomorrow was a big day for Tofu. They felt very tired.

##
Tofu ate a hearty breakfast and set off with Tiya. When they reached the place where the tournament was held, Tofu saw that the elephants participating were much bigger than him. He got very frightened and told Tiya he would quit the contest. Tiya told him that 'Tofu respect is very important and, if you quit the contest you will loose respect. But, if you stand and try your best you will gain respect not loose it '.

##
Tofu then , tried his best in the competition and won the race. Tofu then realized that trying is better than being scared.

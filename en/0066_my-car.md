# My Car

##
Hi, I am Khaidi. I am seven years old.

I have a car, a lovely long car. Papa made it for my birthday.

##
I love my car and love to drive it all day long.
Drooomm... here I go ...drooomm... there I go.
Drooomm... I go everywhere.

##
I visit my relatives driving my car,

and in school, my friends want my car.

I love my grandma and she loves to see me drive.

##
With my car I can go round and round my home.

With my car I can go around the earth.

I can go around the sun, the moon and the stars.

##
My little brother loves riding on my car.

Mummy tells us not to do so, but do we care!

##
Now, here I am without my car and...

my brother without his tooth!

But still we go drooomm...

with my brother on my back!

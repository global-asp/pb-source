# Pehelwaan Ji

##
Pehelwaan ji!

##
He drinks ten litres of milk everyday.

##
He eats fifty rotis.

##
He lifts weights of a hundred kilos.

##
He walks with a swagger.

##
He orders all the children about.

##
One day, Gappu said, “Will you wrestle with me?”

##
Pehelwaan ji laughed. And then agreed.

##
Both of them slapped their thighs!

##
Pehelwaan ji caught hold of Gappu.

##
Gappu tickled him in the stomach.

##
Hee...Heee...Heeee... Pehelwaan ji jumped!

##
As Gappu tickled him, Pehelwaan ji began to dance.

##
Ha...Ha...Hee...Hee...Hoo...Hoo...

Pehelwaan ji rolled about helplessly. And he ran away.

##
The kids are not scared of him any more. He is scared of them.

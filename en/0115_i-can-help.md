# I Can Help!

##
I am a big girl.

I can help other people.

##
After school, I like to feed my brother.

He loves it.

##
When I have a holiday,

I help my mother to get ready to go to the office.

##
In the evening, I help my father in his shop.

##
But sometimes my mother says, “Please, do not help me!”

##
And sometimes my father says,

“Thank you, but please do not help me today.”

##
Sometimes they both tell me to sit in one place.

I like to read a book then!

##
I like to help my grandmother.

She tells me stories.

##
My brother is still small.

He cannot help at all.

##
But I am a big girl.

##
I can help other people.

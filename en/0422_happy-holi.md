# Happy Holi!

##
"Sheela, Sheela!", shouted Ramu. Muttering and grumbling, Sheela woke due to her brother, Ramu's shouts." Am I the only one you find to wake up in the house?", questioned Sheela." I don't want to wake you up but I want to show you something splendid. The streets are filled with people and flowers. Tall and short, fat and thin, beautiful and ugly, literate and illiterate, kind and unkind, good and bad. Every kind of person is there.", said Ramu

##
Sheela sat up, concentrating on Ramu's words. The next moment she rushed to the window. Sheela thought, Why are the streets colourful, Why is everyone outside, Why, why, why? She took the calendar and saw the date, Oh! The answer to all her "Why's", is that today is Holi! Ramu and Sheela stared at one another blankly. Suddenly Ramu broke the silence, "Sheela lets go to Shyamlal Uncle's sweet shop to buy sweets for the Holi celebrations.

##
Off they went at the speed of lightning to uncle's sweet shop." Uncle, Uncle, 5 dozen of motichoor laddoos for the Holi celebrations. Amma(mother) will pay as soon as the celebrations are over.", requested Sheela. Ramu grabbed the sweets and they both rushed to the river bank where the celebrations were happening. Ram, Lakshmi, Shriya and Rita were already there, waiting for Ramu and Sheela. First Ramu offered them sweets and then they started to play

##
pichkaris, water guns, water balloons and of course colours. While playing Sheela thought," Amma does not come out to play because she is scared of water. Only if she knew how fun it is! It is a bit hard to persuade Amma but I know that it is entirely possible." With this thought in her head, she made her way through the crowd to fetch Amma but what a sight! Amma was coming towards the river with a sack full of pichkaris.

##
Sheela ran and hugged Amma," Finally you have come out to play. It is really fun." Grabbing Amma's hand, Sheela rushed to the Holi site. Amma and Sheela splashed each other. Amma didn't mind being splashed in fact she found it fun. Ramu also was very shocked to see Amma. Daddy used to like Holi from before so even he was enjoying a lot. Sheela and Ramu loved when Amma would smile and this was was one chance when they could see her smile.

##
Once the Holi celebrations were over, Ramu and Sheela brought along their friends. Everyone was doing something or the other. Amma had gone to uncle's sweet shop to pay him. Everyone was sad that Holi was over but Daddy doesn't want everyone to be sad so he said, "Holi will come again next year!" But I always say that 365 DAYS IS A VERY LONG TIME TO WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

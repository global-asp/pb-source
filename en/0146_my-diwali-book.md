# My Diwali Book

##
It is November.

I am dreaming of Diwali.

##
Amma says it is the Festival Of Lights.

##
My Grandma read me a book about Diwali.

The book said Diwali is celebrated because Goodness won over Evil.

##
My Grandma says if I do good things, I win too.

So I always share my things with my friends.

##
Amma, Appa and I went to buy new clothes for Diwali

I bought a few dresses in my favorite colors.

##
Amma and Appa made a lot of yummy food!

Mixture, chakli, ladoo, barfi and even chocolate cake. My favorite is the ribbon pakoda and Peda.

##

Tomorrow is Diwali! We decorate our house with Torans.

We then decided to make a big kolam.

##
On Diwali day, I woke up first.

##
Appa and Amma were surprised.

I even washed my hair without crying.

##
I wore my new dress.
Amma wore a saree.
Appa and I helped her with the pleats.

##
Appa said Amma looked like a queen. I thought she looked like a Princess!

##
We ate all the yummy food.

I also helped Amma take some goodies to my friend's house.

##
In the evening, we took out the decorated diyas and lit them.

Amma Appa asked me to be careful.

##
Then we went to light some sparklers.

Our house looked so beautiful.

It was the best Diwali we celebrated!

# Oliver beats his problem!

##
It was a snowy morning. Oliver woke up from bed and went to the bathroom, to brush his teeth. Then he took his bath. His mom gave him his breakfast. He ate it and packed his bag to school. The school bus came to pick him up at 7am. He was very excited because he was eager to sign up for the upcoming cross country race at his school.

##
His teacher told him that he could sign up, but he needed to practice well and take care of his health and keep fit. Oliver loved to eat chocolates, muffins, cookies and chips. He could be found munching on these, all the time.

##
He became very fat and could hardly play with his pup. He really had a bad time at school with all the kids teasing him. While playing a game of tag at school, he could not even run! He expressed to his mom, all that he was going through. His mom felt very sad for him but she made him understand that he has to give up his unhealthy eating habits and turn a new leaf.

##
To take part in the race, he needed to be fit. So his mom signed him up in a gym nearby, and in swimming classes to get him fit. He got very tired after the school and the gym class. He felt so bad, that he could not go to the running race, because he was fat! So he started to exercise with vigour and enthusiasm.

##
Because of the training in the gym and eating healthy food, Oliver got fit and felt very happy. It was Sports day at school and his teacher wished him good luck, pleased with his efforts.

##
He ran so fast and won the race! Everyone cheered him, "Oliver is the fastest, Oliver is the fastest", and he got a huge Golden trophy for securing the 1st place. He hugged his mom and thanked her for all her support and felt very happy and proud of his achievement.

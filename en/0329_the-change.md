# The Change

##
I heard a noise from the kitchen so I went there and saw all plates fallen down and mom at the corner frightened she was shivering she told nothing

##
It was Holi and I went out to celebrate but eyery one ran away from me and I saw my height decreased. I was in house then and wonder what happened. My mom kicked me out of house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????

##
Then I saw myself in the mirror and got shocked!! I had turned into an alien blue colour!! I wanted to know to know what happened. So I recollected and thought what happened to mom. Why was she frightened. Too many questions but less time. Then I got a idea. That I will go in space and search with my friend.

### 2 months later

At last I made a rocket and took my friend and flew.

##
We at last came on planet Mars and were happy we started finding and my friend (Rot) and me (Ron) started finding the reason.

##
Rot called me and told there is a wand here then I picked it up.

##
Then I picked it up and it shined and and did not see Rot then I saw my friend I the rocket and going!!!!!!!!!!!!! How should I go home I said.

##
The wand shined again and a bright light came and closed my eyes and when I opened my eyes I saw a garden looking same as my. Was I home I thought.

##
I saw a boy. I then hid my self he looked like Rot and saw my rocket near him, I waited for him to go till then it was night.

Then I went near a house I saw myself sleeping a noise came and I hid myself and saw a flying cap moving near him he was then on his head and his head turned blue then I thought that because of him I turned and he will cure me so I took of the cap and I wore it and went out and my height increased hair came on my body my body structure changed and I became human again then I went in the rocket and back to Mars then I again saw a light and I saw me playing holi I was cured and threw the cap and wand in dustbin and next I told the story to my teacher and all friends but no one belived except Rot sp h il50 cr50.

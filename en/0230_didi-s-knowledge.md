# Didi's knowledge

##
Didi walks past a deserted area where she sees some poor children.

##
While sleeping, she thinks about educating the children and raising them as her own.

##
She brings the children home and raises them. The next day, she teaches the children how to read.

##
After the day was over, she tucked them into bed.

##
Didi also taught them how to draw and write.

##
After a few years, Didi got a job. So after the children came back from school, they had to study on their own.

##
There was an earthquack and the children had to move!

##
The children had to set up their own house in the mountain.

##
After a few years, the children went back to the village. It was rebuilt and Didi had come back!

##
Didi went back to teaching the kids. She will always be remembered.

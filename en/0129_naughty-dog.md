# Naughty Dog

##
We are a family of four. I follow Chinku everywhere.

##
I have to look after Chinku. You see, I am older than him.

##
Sometimes Chinku is careless. It is my duty to guard the house.

##
We do everything together. We work together.

##
We play together.

##
We even share Ma's scolding.

##
When Chinku is at school I help Ma. I keep the crows away from the papads.

##
Today Chinku will be my teacher. At last, I will learn something new.

##
I am a good doggy. I do not scare away cats.

##
Are you Chinku's friend? Then you are my friend too.

##

##

Sometimes we say, “As faithful as a dog”. This is because a dog always stays close to its master. If it goes far away or is lost, a dog always finds its way back home.

# Hacking Is Life Part 2 - The Kid Can't Be Kidnapped

##
Welcome to the 2nd part of Hacking Is Life.

So lets continue with a young mind with a lot of power that could change the world, Alex a school kid who is 12 years old when he made a virus an online software as you read in the 1st part of this e- book so go and check out the first version! ............................................................

Next day when he checked the victim count he was shocked! It was 99945213 people who were the victims! Now he could use there data use there computer! Access there Gmail, Facebook, Twitter accounts! And 4 foolish people of 99945213 people gave there bank accounts so Alex decided to access there webcam, bank account, and social networking sites to check out are they poor or so much rich

When he accessed the first persons webcam and saw his picture and his house he saw that his bank account only had 5 $ and he was from U. S. A and his video that was coming was as that he applied for a IPHONE 6 plus for free (which was Alex, s virus window loop ) he too said that "we will sell that iphone and then we can do our dad's operation '' he said this to her sister :( Alex thought that he should not take his money . Alex could hack bitcoins which are called the internet currency so he hacked his computer again and made a window that popped up saying "you won 300000 $ " that Alex made and then when the victim clicked to the button what to do now? Alex donated 300000 $ to his bank account! Alex is good too! Then the victim was happy and then he went to a hospital's site saying please give money for the operation . All the left 3 were the most greedy people so what? Alex took there all money! Because all of 3 people were hackers :P it's ironic a little.

The time he was doing this all, someone tracked him . When Alex went out of his house for some fresh air, then he saw a person running to him and then the person caught him and injected something to him using a injection! When he woke he saw three people who were standing, those three people told him to hack some bitcoins! Alex replied "you can track me and can't hack some bitcoins shame on you!" one of then said "you ... You .. Knew it?"

Yeah said Alex . Then one of them said just hack! He got a laptop and put that in a table and said hack using it! Alex replied "ok" and you know if a hacker got a laptop anything could happen! So yeah L. O. L he remade computer operating systems and that software could match his computer's data to it you know what I am saying. Then he destroyed the computer's every single software and before that he tracked himself that where he is and booked a taxi silently, after all this he shutted the laptop down and

Saw that there were 4 people, one was in the bathroom and second was talking to someone and third was just walking and fourth was in the next to that room then you know what Alex did? He shutted the laptop down and with full power he threw it at the head of the second person and when the third person noticed it there was a foke near him he throw to the third person and then he locked the toilets door and slowly went out and locked all the doors from the outside and then ran and caught the taxi and when he returned home his mother father gave the money to the driver and said to Alex where was you from these three hour? Alex replied "at a friend's house"

Wait for the next part....................................

# The Indigo Fairy and the Frogs

##
To walk, a child needs his parents, but to fly, the child needs the entire universe and all its creations.

All Indigo Fairy children leave home when they can walk and go on a journey full of adventure, new friends and discovery where they learn to fly!

As Kian left home, his mother said,

“Dear little one, always be polite and you will find that finding your flower guide will be a lot of fun!"

##
Kian, the Indigo Fairy at this moment meditates on a lotus flower with the frogs.

Using his mother's advice he asks very politely-

“Dearest frogs, I wonder if you could help me find a flower, a very special flower with great, great power!”

##
His friend, a swimming frog leads him across the pond to a lovely flower which might just be the one, it's as white as snow and grows under the sun.

##
Flower guides are very distinct,
a fairy knows his guide by pure instinct.
The flower starts to sway and dance;
this puts the fairy into a special trance!

Lying among the lovely white snowflakes,
Kian knows his search must continue.

The green frogs point the way to the forest.

##
A leaping frog takes Kian deep into the forest where the passion flower lives.

“Thank you leaping frog, it is truly beautiful.
Even though it is not the one,
it makes my heart glad and hopeful!”

“Dear fairy, if you stop for a rest, it might be of interest
to visit the wise tree frog that lives among the mushrooms in this forest.”

##
Kian sits silently in an empty bird's nest for a while,
he and the wise tree frog open their eyes together and smile.

The wise tree frog sends Kian off to meet his friend who always gets a dreamy look when he talks about his flower!

“Dear Fairy, I would like to leave you with this little rhyme-

If only we would take the time to stay,
we would learn a lot along the way.

An adventure you see is rarely about the end,
it is about the start, the middle and things
that await us around the bend!”

##
“Your flower indeed is very sweet
and it was ever so nice to meet,
but I will just be on my way.”

As Kian was leaving, he was a little confused,
this visit seemed to be of no use.
It was then that he decided to stay.

As he gazed at the frog, he could now see
a flower is only as special as we make it out to be.

##
The Hungry Frog

“Take a break and have a treat,
this dragonfly is good enough to eat!”

“Thank you, I had better join you,
watching the dragonfly crumble is making my belly rumble!”

Munch munch munch
goes Kian as he happily eats
his orange carrot with a crunch.

##
Mommy and Daddy Frog

Fattened up after his snack, Kian sees a frog on another frog's back!

“Dearest frogs, I wonder if you could help me find a flower , a very special flower with great, great power!"

“We are very busy laying our eggs as you can see”

“Oh dear! Oh dear! How rude of me!”

“Sweet little fairy, if you come back in a while,

we might be able to show you a flower which will make you smile!”

##
“Good bye dearest frogs, it has been ever so fun,
I am thrilled, just thrilled to have found the one!”

“Will the dandelion take you home?”

“That I really could not say, but I learnt a lot and it was all play,
so farewell dear friends, I will be on my way!”

Dangling from a dandelion, a gust of wind blows Kian away to his next adventure.

##
At the exact same time as Kian finds his special flower, the dandelion, other Indigo Fairy children who started their journey with him also find their flower guides.

You see Indigo Fairies are only as strong as they can be together so while their journeys are separate, the learning is shared.

# Silly & Billy Meet the Ministry of Petrol Pumps

##
Once upon a time in Donkgoat village there was a donkey named Silly and a goat named Billy. One day Silly was watching television . On television he was watching ministry of petrol pumps. So Silly decided to meet the ministry of petrol pumps. They packed their bags and left. They went to Dester station to catch a subway at 6;00 am. Silly was lazy but Billy was active and so they woke up early and ran to the station and boarded the subway.

So Silly got subway-sick . He lay down and Billy watched the wonderful sight. They got off at Genter station. Now they bought a Slackcar (A snake type car) for 7,955 Donklet (currency of Donkgoat). They travelled the rest of journey in the Slackcar. At last they met the ministry of petrol pumps.

They forgot what they were there for. They took a lot of time to think but could not remember. They both were wagging their

tails while thinking. And yet they could not remember. So they shook hands with the Ministry of Petrol Pumps and left for home.

They lived happily ever after.

THE END.

# Listen to My Body

##
Today I am not going to school.

##
It is a holiday!

##
Today I am not going to watch TV.

##
There is no electricity anyway.

##
What am I going to do?

##
Today I am going to listen to my body!

##
First, I have to be quiet. Very quiet.

So that I can listen to my own body.

##
Yes, now I can hear my breath.

In... out... in... out...

##
And I can make my breath noisier... Ssssssssssssss!

And softer... Mmmmmmm.

##
And now I can hear my heart beating!

Doodom, doodoom, dooodooom.

##
Can I make my heart go faster or louder?

Yes, by jumping up and down twenty times.

##
Now see, my heart is beating faster.

Doodom, doodoom, dooodooom!

##
And if I put my fingers on my wrist

then I can hear my pulse!

##
And I can hear myself laughing

Haha haha haaah haaa!

##
And crying

Boohooohooo!

##
And clapping

Tap tappa tap tapaa.

##
And most of all - I can hear my stomach rumbling

Guddu guddu guddu...

##
And saying

Feed me, feed me.

##
And my nose can hear jalebis frying in mothers kitchen.

##
It is fun listening to my body.

And now I want to hear my jaws chewing.

##
And my stomach slurping on mothers wonderful hot jalebis!

##
Match the sounds with the part of the body

Hands - Whistle

Lips - Clap-clap

Feet - Stomp-stomp

One day, Sheema was going out to play. She played in the mud.

##
When she got home, Her mother, Mrs Kamala saw Sheema and scolded her for she was all dirty. Sheema started to cry. Her mother gave her a bar of soap.

##
Sheema took the bar of soap and had her bath. She ate her dinner and brushed her teeth. Her mother was very happy.

##
When she was sleeping, she dreamt that she was a princess. She dreamt that she was being captured by bugs.

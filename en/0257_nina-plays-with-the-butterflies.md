# Nina Plays With the Butterflies

##
Once upon a time, there was a girl called Nina. She loved butterflies a lot. One day, Nina saw a lot of butterflies sitting on a flower bush. She wanted to touch and see them. So she ran but the butterflies flew away and she came back sadly.

##
The next day, Nina again went to the flower bush to see the butterflies. But when the butterflies came Nina's mother called her and she couldn't see them.

##
After awhile, Nina came back to the flower bush but it started raining. She waited and waited and waited for a long time. When she really got tired of waiting, she decided to go back home.

##
The next day, she said to her mother rather crossly, “This is the final day, that I am going to the flower to see the butterflies.”

##
After a few minutes, she went back to the flower bush and all the butterflies came. Nina happily played with all of them and she called her Mother and said, “I saw a lot of butterflies come and take a look at it, mother.” Both Nina and her mother, enjoyed the butterflies together.

# Anty's Team

##
On the rose bush, Anty, the little black ant was playing with her friends. She caught hold of a leaf and climbed down. Some of her friends called her ‘brave' while some whispered ‘she is mad'.

Anty reached the edge of the leaf and looked up. All appeared upside down. She could see only the bobbing heads of her friends.

Delighted, she raised her head higher and cupped her hands to shout, “Hurray!”

She lost balance and fell straight down. Her head spinning, in fright, she shut her eyes tightly.

Anty fell on a ball of fur and opened her eyes slowly. Brown hair was spread all over. Wondering where she was, she parted strands of hair and peeked out. A black long stick grabbed her instantly.

“You silly ant, you spoiled my sleep,” growled Browny, the squirrel.

He threatened to smash her. Anty's mother saw her falling down and dashed to her rescue. She pleaded with the raging squirrel to forgive Anty.

Anty was lucky, as that day Browny was in a good mood. He pitied them and let go of Anty.

Her mother whisked her away. Anty yelled back, “Browny, I will help you one day.”

Anty's mother dragged her hurriedly into the burrow and Browny chuckled at the little ant's courage. Her friends admired her heroism while her mother warned her to be wary of the squirrel.

Two months later, the ants got busy collecting and storing food in their den for the cold winters. Anty and her friends joined their families to gather food. The younger ants were full of energy and wandered far in search of food.

Anty made up a song –

“Hurray Hurray, Merry Merry!

March March, left and right!

Up the hill and down the hill, we go in a line;

East and West, we run in quest;

North and South, we search for grub;

Hurray Hurray, Merry Merry!

March March, left and right!”

Anty and her friends sang at the top of their voice. The older ants were pleased. Anty saw Browny snoring under a tree. She was curious to know why the squirrel didn't collect food like them. But she did not dare to ask him.

The winters were bitter. All the ants rested in their cosy dens. One day, Anty heard a deep moan. She wanted to find out from where it came, but her mother scolded her for prying. Anty pretended to sleep. Once her mother fell asleep, she followed the sound of the moan. It came from outside the oak tree. Browny was shivering with cold at the foot of the oak. His eyes were closed and he appeared to be in pain.

Anty went back into the den and woke up her friends. Together, they thought and thought. They dug a deep burrow and filled it with dry leaves. Now, they had a problem. How will the little ants push the big squirrel into the warm dugout?

Anty said – ‘all of us must push at the same time.' Her friends agreed. And like a leader, she shouted at the top of her voice, “Ready! Set! Go!” At the word go, the ants pushed the squirrel. Browny tumbled into the burrow. They covered him with dry grass.

Browny opened his eyes after a day. Anty and her friends were happy that the squirrel got well and gave him peanuts to eat. The squirrel was grateful and nicknamed them - Anty's team. They became friends.

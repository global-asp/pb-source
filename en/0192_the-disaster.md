Boy:Even I am fine. How come you are so small and I am so big?

Girl:I am under a magic spell. That's why I appear so small to you.

Boy:Who put you under the spell?Maybe I can help you.

Girl:Mrs. Grunty put me under the spell.

Boy:Mrs. Grunty is my mother.

We both go to my house.

Boy:Mom why did you make Thriya so small?

Mom:I made her so small because she was going to spoil my lab by:-

1. Hitting the acid test tube.

2. The acid test tube was going to fall on our cat Mew.

3. It would shout so loud because of getting burnt.

4. Then it would hit me.

Boy: Thriya apologise from mom.

Mom: Ok.

Boy: Make Thriya her normal size.

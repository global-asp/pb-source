# The mouse+dragon

##
Once upon a time there used to be a dragon named Pitu. He used to sunbath and enjoy himself swimming in fresh, cold waters. He didn't move a muscle to help in the fields nor did he help at the bazaar. All he used to do was blow a puff of smoke when anyone asked for help. Pitu used to boss around and always used to find faults in everything. One day the great Hooghly Baba came to Dragondon city.

##
The great Baba arrived with two followers of his. One by one dragons started to pour inside his cabin. There were many different dragons but all had the same complaint. All the Baba heard was Pitu, Pitu, Pitu! The Baba couldn't stand it any longer. He walked to the site where Pitu was relaxing. He chanted a few mantras and then Pitu reduced in size. He was as small as a rat. Now no one could notice him anymore and his voice was so low. Now no one could hear his bossy words.

##
Pitu now a small rat decided to adventure in the city. The crowd towered over him. It seemed that he had lost his own life because he didn't have his powers but when he tried to puff out smoke, Oh yes! Smoke came out from his mouth. A smoke - puffing - out - mouse! Wow! Amazing! Splendid! Now lazy he was, thus he couldn't walk too far. He does not have any choice since he does not have wings.

##
Pitu entered a hut through the window. Oh! Some cheese!Pitu quickly took baby steps and headed towards the cheese. Yum, Yum! Pitu thought that mouse life was much better than dragon life. After Pitu nibbled on the cheese he turned to step back but the house cat was already upon him. Pitu struggled and finally he was free but poor Pitu lost his tail.

##
Pitu wandered the streets and found a nice, old grandma who was fond of rats. Pitu liked sleeping on granny's bed, licking the spoons, drinking from granny's cup, watching television with popcorn. Pitu really enjoyed his stay with granny. Grandma made sure that he was comfortable but also made him work so that he stays fit. Now Pitu is completely different. He now is hardworking. Not lazy. Very surprising!

##
Pitu went back to Dragondon after staying at granny's house. Now he is always the first one on the fields and the bazaar is more lively since he has joined." Good job Pitu! May you live long" said the Baba. Pitu liked his mouse life but dragon life is much better!

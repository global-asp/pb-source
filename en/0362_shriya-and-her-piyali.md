# Shriya and her Piyali

##
Shriya was the only child to her parents.

Her neighborhood had no kids. Shriya felt bored.

##
Her dad felt sorry for Shriya.

He decided to cheer her up by bringing her a pet parrot.

Shriya was very happy.

##
Shriya would spend as much time with her parrot.

She named her 'Piyali'.

She would wave Piyali 'Bye' and then only leave for school.

She would greet Piyali with a 'Hi' when she got back from school.

##
Days passed.

Shriya noticed that Piyali was very dull. She did not respond to Shriya's 'Hi's and 'Bye's.

Shriya wanted to help Piyali but did not know how.

##
She asked Piyali

"O Piyali. Why do you look sad these days?"

"Don't you not like our home?"

To her surprise Piyali replied

"No. I do like it here but I miss my family. I miss my friends/"

Shriya asked Piyali "But are we not your family?"

Piyali replied "Yes. But I like to be with my mother and father. Tell me Shriya, will you be able to live away from your amma and appa?"

Shriya replied "Definitely No".

Piyali replied "See. I can't too. I want to go and live with my family."

##
Shriya could not sleep that night.

Next morning, when she woke up, she went straight to the balcony where Piyali's cage was hung.

She opened the cage and set Piyali free, saying "Go home Piyali. Go back to your amma and appa. Go back to your friends. But do not forget me. Do visit me."

Piyali was very happy. She turned towards Shriya, waved her a Bye and said "Thank you Shriya. We will be friends forever. I will visit you often."

##
As Shriya watched from her balcony, Piyali flew up and up high in the air.

She joined her amma, her appa and her friends who were waiting for her all these days.

##
And they all soared up and up high inthe sky with Piyali leading them.

Piyali squealed in glee.

##
Shriya felt so happy that she set Piyali free and now Piyali was happily living, flying, squealing with her parents, and her friends.

Shriya realised that she needed to be go to the park and make new friends and not feel bored anymore.

So from then on, Shriya and her friends went to the park regularly to play, sing and dance and also hoping that Piyali and her friends would visit them some day.

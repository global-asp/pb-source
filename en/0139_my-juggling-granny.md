# My Juggling Granny

##
Grannies come in many sizes,

And they give us funny surprises!

Did you know my granny juggles?

With her, I like to snuggle!

##
A great spotter of things is she,

She's not one to let things be!

An expert at tossing everything in sight,

People around get quite a fright!

##
Kitchens, office, the street or the market,

She juggles everywhere and cannot stop it!

It's hard for her to check herself,

No one dares to offer her help!

##
Umbrellas and glasses go flying in the air,

Spoiltsports now begin to stare!

Juicy mangoes land with a splash,

Grandfather's teeth begin to gnash!

##
Coloured balls he brings as a gift,

Says, “Toss them all without a twist!”

Granny blushes and feels quite shy,

That she has this lovely gift to try!

##
Grandfather now sleeps through the night,

Granny juggles till the morning light!

Her shadow dances on the curtain,

She's the best, I am certain!

##
Dear Reader,

Have you ever seen jugglers in a circus?

What do they throw in the air?

Do you think it is possible to juggle with items like the ones used by this granny?

# I Can Make Things!

##
I am a big boy now.

I can draw and I can make things.

##
I draw my mother, she sits still.

##
I draw my sister, she does not sit still.

##
I draw many things.

##
But I am told not to draw on the wall.

##
I can make things.

##
I make a drawing of a cat, she is fat.

##
I make a fish. It is small.

##
I make paper boats, birds and planes.

##
I make houses and trains.

##
My sister makes a mess!

I can make many things. But my sister cannot!

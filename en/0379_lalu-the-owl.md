# Lalu the Owl

##
Lalu the owl was a friendly fellow. All the birds in the jungle were his friends.

##
But Lalu's best friend in the jungle was Rainbow, the peacock.

##
Rainbow the peacock was a great entertainer. He could sing and dance really well.

##
One day Lalu organised a party and called all his friends!

##
All of Lalu's friends came and danced and sang songs and even gifted Lalu a crown of feathers.

But Lalu was said. Rainbow had not come to the party.

##
Lalu waited and waited. His eyes were only on the door.

##
Finally he saw Rainbow rushing towards his house. Huffing and puffing.

Ohh, the joy and relief on Lalu's face.

##
Lalu was a happy owl again!

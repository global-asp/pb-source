# Lost and Found

##
Not here, not there.

Where have you gone?

##
Not on the sofa.

Not under the cot.

##
Not in the box.

Not under my sister's frock.

##
Not under the pillow.

Not in my bag.

Sob, sob, where have you gone?

##
I have looked in every room,

l have looked under every book.

##
I have looked under the chair,

I have looked under the stool.

Where have you gone?

##
Soon granny came back from her walk.

"Look what I found in the park."

##
"It can sway, it can bounce.

It can spin, it can dangle.

Ha-ha, hee-hee," said Granny with a giggle.

##
Oh Granny! Thank you so much!

You have found my dear yo-yo!

##
"Yo-yo? What a funny name!

What a funny toy!

I want to play with it,

It gives me so much joy!"

##
Giggle, giggle, giggling away,

Granny played, with my little toy.

For the rest of the day!

# Everything looks new!

##
Today is Vasant Panchami. My parents say it is the first day of spring. Spring is the season between winter and summer. It is called Vasant Ritu in Sanskrit.

##
In many parts of India, people pray to the goddess of learning, music and art on this day. Many birds are sitting on the tree near my house. I think they are singing to me.

##
The leaves on the tree are new and shiny. Just like my new frock. Amma is also wearing a yellow sari ― such a pretty colour ‘basanti', and such a pretty name!

##
Grandpa wants me to plant a tree.

“But why?” I ask.

“So that you will have a friend to grow up with, Meenu,” he says. “Spring is a good season to start something new.”

##
We go to the garden. Grandpa and I dig a hole in the ground and plant a sapling. “How tall will it grow?” I ask him.

##
"Wait and watch, dear Meenu!" he says. The squirrels are chasing each other. Tingu, the cat, chases a squirrel. And I want to chase Tingu.

##
The garden is full of flowers.

I like the yellow roses the best and Grandpa likes the white jasmine. There is a carpet of leaves under some trees.

##
Many trees have flowers.

I like spring!

Everything looks so pretty in spring!

##
Tomorrow is Holi. School is closed for two days. We have made a huge Holika with twigs, and pieces of wood.

Some of us went to the forest and brought tesu flowers. Manu put the flowers in a tank of water. The water has turned a bright orange!

##
Tomorrow we will play Holi with the orange water. We will get gujia and puris to eat.

Spring is such a happy season. It is not cold, it is not hot, and it is not wet.

I can play all the time!

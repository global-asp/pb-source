# Under the sea

##
Rehan and his father sat watching the sea. They had come for a holiday in Srilanka, a place full of beaches. They were looking forward to swimming in the sea, playing in the sand, boating, whale -watching..... But his mother's plan was the best.

##
She suddenly asked Rehan to get ready to go snorkeling with her. This was the first time they were going to dive into the sea. Both of them were excited.

##
Underwater is amazing! Though it was a little difficult to get used to breathing, Rehan soon learnt the trick. He floated, swam and then dived in. He felt good.

##
Ooooooh! It was fascinating to see all kinds of colourful fishes swimming in all directions! There were rocks, corals, flowers, plants,.... all surrounded by the blue sea. The plants were swaying gently as though they were talking.

##
Rehan and his mother went deeper in. They could touch the rocks and the corals underneath. It looked as though they were breathing. A large fish with fins looking like spikes went past them. Another one seemed to have a mustache. Then there were the very tiny ones too!

##
Rehan slowly floated away from his mother. He reached a huge cluster of rocks looking like a hill. There was a huge fish swallowing a couple of smaller ones! The fish almost looked like a snake. Rehan looked for his mother and showed her that.

##
Rehan wanted to tell his mother not to leave him. He was a bit scared now. He decided to follow his mother closely. Another big fish seemed to come towards them. Rehan could also see a large red one behind it, above the rocks. It was all so colourful!

##
Then he saw a turtle nibbling something. Or, was it breathing? Or talking? Rehan wanted to touch it. He swam towards it wondering what would happen if he touched the turtle.

##
Just as he was going towards the turtle, a huge black fish crossed his path. It had its mouth wide open. Rehan thought it was coming to bite him and quickly swam away.

##
Rehan was pulled by his mother and both of them swam back to the surface. It was a wonderful experience! "Does the sea have all the creatures that the land has?" Rehan wondered as he got back to his boat.

##
On the boat , sitting next to his father, Rehan kept thinking about the creatures under the sea. And, his head was full of questions.

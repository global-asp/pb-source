# Happy world

Aloke was a cheerful boy. He had a smile always that would make anyone around him happy. Even in the saddest moments he would cheer up thinking the bad phase would be over soon.

One night post dinner, after saying a goodbye to the smiling moon, in his sleep he had a dream that there was a dinosaur who was very cheerful and enjoyed being in the bright sun as much as he did in the rain. Aloke too felt he was close to nature and happy as the dino.

When Aloke woke up in the morning he couldn't remember the rest of the dream but it was cloudy dark weather outside. His mom who was making breakfast asked Aloke to get ready and reach school before it rains. He asked her, " Ma can I get wet in the rains after school?" His mom replied hesitatingly " Er.. yes but not for too long."

Once school was over he rushed back home. After a quick snack and change of dress, he was waiting excitedly for the clouds to shower rains. It hadn't rained since morning as though the sky was waiting for Aloke. Suddenly it started drizzling. He could hear his mom saying in a loud voice, " Aloke don't be out there in the rains for too long." But as soon as he closed his eyes he could see once again the happy dinosaur's face." Aloke just enjoyed the moment.

For others who were seeing Aloke getting drenched in the rain, it was a sight worth capturing in a painting or a photograph.

Aloke was just happy and there was a little frog too imitating what Aloke was doing. Only those who wanted to be happy could see Aloke's happiness too.

Interestingly the little frog like Aloke was enjoying the nature, the smell of mother earth and the rains with both hands towards the sky.

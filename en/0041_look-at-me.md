# Look At Me

##
Look at us.

Do you want to be our friend?

##
My legs are very strong.

I can run really fast with them.

##
And my arms... such a nice swing!

##
I like to draw.

I use my hands for drawing.

##
Should I draw your picture?

I can see you with my eyes.

##
The bird sings a sweet song.

I can hear it with my ears.

##
I think Ma is making halwa.

I can smell it with my nose.

##
Oh! This sugarcane is so tough! But my teeth are strong too!

##
It is very sweet.

My tongue just told me.

##
I can sing.

Should I sing you a song?

##
Ma says I have a good voice. Does it come from my throat?

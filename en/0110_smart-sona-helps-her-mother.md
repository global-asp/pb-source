# Smart Sona Helps Her Mother

##
Sona's mother was making prints on a sari with a block.

Sona said, “Ma, I want to make prints too.”

##
Ma gave Sona a piece of cloth and some colours.

##
The room was full of things that helped in making printed cloth.

##
Ma said, “Sona, why don't you sit outside and print? Listen carefully to the sounds of my printing.”

##
Sona sat at a small table outside.

##
When there was no sound from the room Sona knew that Ma was quietly putting colours on the block.

Then Sona would also colour her block. When she heard the sound thupp, Sona would press her block on to the cloth.

##
Silence-thupp, silence-thupp, Ma and Sona worked together.

##
But there was another small sound that Sona could hear, chun-chanan-chun, that made her smile.

##
After some time Ma called out, “Sona, have you seen my keys? I cannot find them.”

##
Sona went to Ma. She held her around her waist.

##
“Sona, this is no time to play!” Ma said looking around.

“I have to take out the colours from the cupboard. I need the keys. Try to find them please!”

##
Sona pulled the end of Ma's odhni* that was tucked into her waist.

Chun-chanan-chanwent the keys tied to a corner of the odhni, chun-chanan-chan.

*Piece of cloth draped like a shawl.

##
“Oh! How did you know the keys were here?” Ma asked in surprise.

“Ma, I was listening carefully,” laughed Sona.

“Silence-thupp-chunn,

silence-thupp-chunn!”

“You are such a smart girl, Sona!” said Ma.

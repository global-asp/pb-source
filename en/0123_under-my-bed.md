# Under My Bed

##
I wake up at night feeling thirsty. I want to get some water. I start looking for my slippers under the bed.

##
Oh my God! There is a tiger under my bed.

##
Now what should I do?

##
Should I call Ma? What if the tiger roars?

##
Should I just go back to sleep? But I am not sleepy any more.

##
Then someone turns on the light. Ma is standing at the door.

##
“What happened dear?Did you call me?” asks Ma.

##
I point towards the tiger. Ma bends and pulls the tiger out from under the bed!

##
Hey, this is no tiger. This is my thick yellow and black sweater. Its buttons shine like a tiger's eyes.

##
I got scared for nothing!

Ma gets me some water.

##
Now I will sleep. And dream about real tigers in a jungle!

# Amit and his Football

##
Once upon a time, there lived a sister and a brother called Amit and Radha. Amit one day asked his mother 'mom, can I go to a picnic toa swimming pool with my football myself?' His mother told, 'I can't send you. It's very far away and dangerous.' Amit said, 'no mom. I know a swimming pool near by. I will take my swimming suit, football and even Radha. I can't do anything if she does not come.' His mother said, 'ok. but be careful and how will you go?'

'By my bicycle' shouted Amit as he went to call Radha. Radha was painting a picture. Amit asked 'Radha are you coming with me to the swimming pool?' Radha said, 'but you don't know swimming.' Amit said, "I will swim in the baby pool.' Radha said, "I have done swimming a hundred times. I will not come.' Amit asked her so much, but she refused. So he went all by himself. when he reached the swimming pool, he did not know where to park the bycycle. he parked in a place he did not know. He came inside, changed his dress, kept his football, in a place and jumped inside the babypool and played for sometime there and then came out. He changed his dress and was playing with his football. Suddenly his football fell into the deep pool. It was so deep that he could not go there. He asked someones phone and made a call to his

his mother. Radha picked the phone and said 'hello who is this?' Amit said, 'Radha I am Amit. My football fell into the water. As you know underwater swimming, please come and help me. Radha said, 'sure.' and told her mother about this and went to the swimming pool with her bicycle and swimming dress. Amit was waiting for Radha and when she came, he said sadly, 'my football is already drowned.' Radha said, 'It's ok.' She wore her swimming dress and jumped into the water. After a minute, she came out with his football. She gave it to Amit and changed her dress and came to Amit underwater swimming and stay in the water for an hour.' He whispherd, 'Then you will be dead' Radha laughed. Then they both laughed and went home on their bicycles happily.

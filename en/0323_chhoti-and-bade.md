# Chhoti and Bade

##
Chhoti used to love being outdoors. Everyday she would walk through the fields talking and singing to the crops and birds.

##
One day she entered the forest. In the forest she could hear a lot of birds chirping and also some animal sounds.

##
As Chhoti walked through the forest, she saw a huge footprint on the ground. It was so big that both her feet could fit into the print and there was still some extra space.

##
For a brief moment she got really scared! She wondered which animal could be so big and huge. She started thinking about dark and scary things.

##
Then all of a sudden, in the distance, Chhoti saw Bade- the elephant. He was really big. This footprint was surely his.

##
Bade walked up to Chhoti and nudged her with his trunk to say Hello. Chhoti had never seen such kind eyes before

##
Bade lifted Chhoti on to his back and they went for a long walk through the forest. From that day onwards each day Chhoti would sit on Bade's back and they would discover the forest together.

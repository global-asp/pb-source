# The bizarre island

##
Once in a sunny day in December, Rahul was playing cricket in the playground in his apartment. Suddenly a portal appeared; two hands came out and pulled Rahul and his best friend into the portal.

##
They felt very nauseous and very anxious, because the portal was swirling like a million merry-go-rounds. When they were surely inside the portal, there appeared a great big hotel which was shining with all its might .

##
When they went inside the hotel; several dwarf came rushing down to them. The dwarf told the surprised children that the dwarf dinosaur in the bizarre island was ascending towards them by the smell and was going to eat them .

##
Rahul and Javed could defeat Draco (the dinosaur) because they were bigger than him; in fact they were ten feet tall for the dwarf, and five feet taller than Draco. They asked the dwarf that can they go home after the challenge, and the dwarf said they will and with an extra prize.

##
Off they went with increasing courage to defeat him. They were not even halfway when a friendly lion appeared. They were afraid at first but when the lion asked them â€œDo you want to have a ride on my back, there are dangers lurking in the forest, and besides you will reach there faster".

##
So they said they wanted to go to Draco's cave . When they reached the cave, Draco was sleeping. He woke up with a roar. They got ready to fight Draco. Suddenly a big rock came falling down just above Javed, before Rahul could do anything, Draco stopped the stone with his horns

##
what an unexpected surprise! Draco was kind and loving and wanted to make friendship with the dwarf So they went back to the hotel riding on Draco's back. The dwarf were so afraid that they ran and hid inside the big, old bed.

##
Rahul & Javed told the dwarf that Draco wanted to be friends with him. The dwarf took trust in them and kept Draco with them. Rahul and Javed went out of the portal after the goodbyes and they took a trophy with HONOR MEDAL inscribed on it.

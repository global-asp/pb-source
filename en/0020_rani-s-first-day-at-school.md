# Rani's First Day at School

##
It is my first day at school.

Mummy is holding my hand and walking with me.

“I am grown up now,” I say. “Let go, let go!”

Mummy holds my hand very tight.

##
There are many children near the school.

They come by bus. They come by car.

They come by rickshaw. They cycle.

They walk, like me.

##
We reach the gate. Mummy lets go of my hand.

She stays at the gate. I have to go inside alone.

There are many new faces all around me.

##
I take one step. I take another step. I look back. Mummy gets smaller as I walk away. Will she disappear?

I run back to her. I don't feel so grown up. I hold her hand.

“Don't go away,” I say.

##
Everyone is inside now. I am the only one outside. The teacher comes out. She smiles at me. I smile back.

Mummy says, "Rani, I will be here when you come out."

I let go of her hand. She waves to me.

##
I run inside. Mummy will be there after school!

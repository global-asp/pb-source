# Ham and Lily

##
Once upon a time there was a deer and her name was Lily and she had a friend bird named Coco. Coco was very clever and smart. Every day they went to a meadow to eat food but they never realized that there was a cave and in that cave lived a wolf named Ham and he loved eating meat and especially a deer. One day Lily and Coco went to the meadow to eat their breakfast when Ham got a nightmare and he woke up and went out and as soon as he walked out he saw Lily and he thought she was his breakfast but he knew that she won't come and allow ham to eat her so he made a plan. He went outside and asked Lily "Can I by your friend I don't have a friend or family". Lily agreed but Coco told her not to believe him but Lily didn't listen all she wanted was a new friend. The next day when they all went to the meadow for breakfast and Ham thought of making a trap so he told Lily "I will take you to a place where there is fresh grass".

So he took her to a farmer's crop and then waited and waited and after they went the farmer came and looked at his crops and what he saw was that some one is eating her crops and so she thought of putting a trap to find who was eating her crops.

The next day early morning she put a net and she waited in her hut, then the deer came alone and started to it but she didn't notice the net. After she finished she got to know that she was glued to the net so she called for help, after some time her friend Coco came and asked her "What is the matter?" "I am stuck " replyed Lily. Then Coco got an idea and told Lily to play dead so she did and when the farmer saw her dead the farmer felt

Ashamed of herself and so she untied Lily and as soon as she took the net away Lily ran as fast as she could and the farmer threw a wooden bat so coco turn it to Ham and the bat hit Ham's head and he died.

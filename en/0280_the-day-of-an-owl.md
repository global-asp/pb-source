# The day of an owl

##
I am an owl

I see in the night....

##
.....and I sleep all the day

##
One day all the birds woke me up from the sleep

##
Cause their friend is falling on the ground.....

##
.....and vulture moving around

##
All of us helped the bird to get on the branch

##
The peacock danced for me

##
All the birds are happy

##
I am again sleepy....

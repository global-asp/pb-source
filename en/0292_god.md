# God

##
Once god came to earth.

##
He is god - recognized by peacock and gave him a peacock eye. He adored it, on head.

##
He is god - recognized by bamboo and gave him a bamboo shoot. He adored it in hand as flute -'murali'.

##
He is god - recognized by bushes and trees, gave him flowers. He adored them as garland-'mala'.

##
He is god - recognized by cow and gave him milk and followed him. He has become lord 'Krishna'.

##
He has seen beggar, asking for alms. He appeared before him. Beggar thought him as another beggar, in krishna's attire. He told him, he is busy seeking alms.

##
He went to him , in the shape of human, and the beggar asked him for alms, and he gave.

God then decided, to help humans, I come in human shape, they donot recognise any other form. To save any other being, I will go as god!

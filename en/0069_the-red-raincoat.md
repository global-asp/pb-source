# The Red Raincoat

##
On Sunday, Manu's parents got him a red raincoat.

“Ma, may I wear it now?” asked Manu.

“No, my dear, the rains are near, but just now the sky is clear,” said Ma.

##
Monday was bright and sunny.

“WILL it rain today, Mummy?” asked Manu.

“No Manu, not today. If you wear your raincoat, you will look quite funny!” said Ma.

##
On Tuesday, the sky was blue.

“Ma, WHEN will my wish come true?” asked Manu.

“Not today, my dear, there is just one white cloud in the sky!” said Ma.

##
Wednesday was hot.

“Ma, WHY doesn't it rain?” asked Manu.

“Son, I think it will rain very soon. Maybe even before it is noon,” said Ma.

##
On Thursday Manu went on a picnic. “Ma, WHAT if it rains? Shall I take the raincoat with me?” asked Manu.

“No my dear, it will not rain today. The little white clouds are too high in the sky,” said Ma.

##
Friday was cloudy.

“Ma, will it rain today?” asked Manu loudly.

“It might, my dear. There are some dark clouds low down in the sky,” said Ma.

##
Saturday began with a bang!

Badaboom!

"Ma, is that thunder I hear? Will it rain very soon?" asked Manu.

##
And then at last, it started raining!

“Oh, it's raining, it's raining,” sang Manu, running out.

##
“But Manu,” called Ma, running after him, “you forgot your raincoat!”

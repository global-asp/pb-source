# The Many Tails of Jiril the Squirrel

##
Jiril the squirrel sat on the branch of a tree. He was all alone.

##
Jiril felt lonely. He wished he could play with his friends.

##
He ran down the tree to the ground. He did not find his friends
but he did find an acorn to eat.

##
Jiril looked and looked for his friends but he could not find them.
He took a nap because he was tired.

##
When Jiril woke up, he decided to climb the tree again.
But he was still half asleep and he rolled down to the ground.

##
Soon he found his friends playing and eating.

Jiril was happy now as he was not alone.

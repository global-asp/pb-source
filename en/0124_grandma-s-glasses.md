# Grandma's Glasses

##
Nani keeps losing her glasses.

“Where did I keep them?” she always asks. Without her glasses, she cannot find her glasses.

##
So she needs me. To be her eyes, to find her own eyes!

##
Sometimes her spectacles are in the bathroom. Or on her bed. Or on her head.

“Nani,” I say, “they are on your head!”

##
“Of course! How silly of me. Thank you, Richa dear,” she says with a giggle.

This time, though, I cannot find Nani's glasses. Not yet.

##
I have looked everywhere. In all the usual places. On her head, in the bathroom, inside her cupboard, and on the puja shelf. I have looked under her favourite chair and on the dining table.

Nothing. No glasses. Where could they be?

##
I decided to be a good detective. I decided to find out what she had done all day.

##
“I did nothing much today. Except that Veena's mother-in-law came, you know. And how much she gossips! We had many cups of tea. And she ate all the laddoos your mother had made,” said Nani.

##
Raju said, “Nani was very busy today. She wrote a letter to the Chief Minister about her pension.”

##
Amma said, “She spoke for a long time to your Masi. She finished knitting the sweater for Raju. And then she went for a short walk.”

I now had many clues. I quickly looked around new places in the house.

Aha! I have found the missing glasses!

##
The spectacles were wrapped in wool, kept next to her pen, under the phone, on her desk. And I found a half-eaten laddoo there as well. For Nani's next birthday, I will save money for an extra pair of glasses!
